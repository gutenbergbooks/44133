<h2>CHAPTER I.<br/>

<small>THE BURTONS.</small></h2>


<div class="floatl">
  <img class="plain" src="images/i03.jpg" width="178" height="214" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap16">
<span class="smcaps"><span class="invisible">W</span>innifred Burton</span>
sat all alone in
the pleasant sitting-room,
curled up in
an easy-chair so
large that her little
figure was almost
lost in its great
depths. The fire in the open grate burned
brightly, sending out little tongues of
flame which made dancing shadows on the
walls and ceiling, and flashed ever and
anon on the bright hair and face and dress
of the little girl sitting so quiet before it.</p>

<p>It was a dismal day near the close of
January. Snow had been falling steadily
all day, and the window-sill was already
piled so high with it that by and by it
would have to be brushed away in order
to close the shutters. But Winnifred was
so absorbed in the book she was reading
that she knew nothing of all this. The
book was a new edition of "The Giant
Killer; or, The Battle That All Must
Fight." She was just reading how the
brave but tempted Fides lay in the dreadful
Pit of Despair; of how he had fallen
back, bruised and bleeding, time after
time, in his endeavors to cut and climb his
way out, before he found the little cord of
love which was strong enough to draw
him out with scarcely an effort of his
own.</p>

<p>Twilight was fast closing in around the
little reader, and all the letters on the page
were beginning to dance up and down.
Impatiently shaking herself, Winnifred
slipped down from her chair, gave the fire
a little poke, and settled herself on the
floor in front of it, holding the book so
that she could see to read by the flickering
light. But she had scarcely begun to do
so, when the door opened. She gave a
little jump, and turned quite red in the
face.</p>

<p>But it was only her little brother Ralph,
who said: "'Innie, mamma says if 'oo
have 'oor lessons done, 'ou'se to come out
and set the table for supper."</p>

<p>Her lessons done! Winnie glanced at the
pile of books lying on the table by the
window. Yes, there they all were&mdash;her
geography, history, grammar, arithmetic.
When now would she have time to learn
those lessons? And she felt that she had
been dishonest, too, because her mother
<a class="pagenum" name="page_04" title="4"> </a>
would perhaps have had something else
for her to do, if she had not supposed she
was studying hard. However, there was
no help for it now, and with a rueful face
she left the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton was in the kitchen, so that
Winnie escaped being questioned, but just
now she was taking herself to task, for she
had a very guilty conscience, and was wondering
when she was going to begin fighting
her giants. She knew only too well
what one of them was, and she knew also
that if she could not find time to learn
those lessons, another punishment beside
the stings of her conscience would await
her on the morrow.</p>

<p>But presently her father and older
brother came home; little Ralph ran to
get their slippers, while they took off their
wet boots; supper was put on the table,
and they all sat down to the cheerful
meal.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Burton had few rules for
their household, but they had one which
was imperative: nothing but cheerful
faces and cheerful conversation was allowed
at the table. Business or household
worries were kept for private conference,
and the little griefs of the children
were not allowed to be mentioned.</p>

<p>Winnie soon forgot her anxiety in listening
to the things that her father and
brother Jack were saying, and, as the talk
was about politics, and the tariff, and the
state of the market, other little girls may
not be so interested as Winnie tried to
make herself believe that she was. So
this will be a good time to describe them
all, as they sit at the table.</p>

<p>All of their acquaintances spoke of the
Burtons as a very happy family, and this
opinion was undoubtedly correct, the reason
for which will appear later.</p>

<p>Mr. Burton is a tall, handsome, young-looking
man, with brown eyes having a
merry twinkle in them; his eyebrows and
moustache are dark and heavy, and his
firm mouth and chin show character and
decision.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton looks as young as her husband,
and Winnie is always taken by
strangers to be her younger sister, which
is a source of great delight and comfort
to the girl, as she is very proud of her
dainty and stylish mother. Mrs. Burton
has soft brown hair, always prettily
dressed; her eyes are a deep, soft blue,
shaded by long, curling lashes, and with
straight, delicate eyebrows above. Although
she does much of the household
work, she manages, in some mysterious
manner, to keep her hands soft and white.
Winnie sometimes steals up behind her
mother and puts her own little brown
hands beside one of the soft white ones
with a little sigh&mdash;for she would like her
own to be soft and white, too&mdash;but more
often with a merry laugh.</p>

<p>Eighteen-year-old Jack, except that he
gives promise of attaining his father's
noble inches, is much like his mother. He
had been intended for one of the professions,
but all of his talents and inclinations
having pointed to business, his
<a class="pagenum" name="page_05" title="5"> </a>
father finally yielded the point of having
him go through college, and, upon his
graduation from high-school the year
previous, took him into his own real estate
office.</p>

<p>Winnie has eyes and
hair like her father,
but, in spite of her
twelve years, is so
small and slight that
she looks like a child
of nine or ten.</p>

<p>Four-year-old Ralph
is the pet and beauty
of the family. His
hair curls in loose
rings all over his head.
His hazel eyes have
such large, dilating
pupils, and such a way
of shining when anything
is given him,
that his young aunts
and uncles, together
with Winnie and Jack,
are always giving him
something for the
pleasure of seeing his
wondering look.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear," said Mr. Burton to
his wife, as they rose from the table,
"anything on the carpet for to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you don't think the weather
too bad, I'd like to call on Mrs. Brown after
Ralph is put to bed."</p>

<p>"Winnie, I should like you to accompany
Jack in one of his new violin studies,
while we are gone; but you must not forget
that half past nine is your bed-time."</p>

<div class="center">
  <img class="plain" src="images/i05.jpg" width="498" height="595" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">"Now for the new music," Jack said.&mdash;See page 6.</p>
</div>

<p>Poor Winnie! She dearly liked playing
Jack's accompaniments, but the unlearned
lessons rose up before her, and
she said, "Oh, mamma, I can't to-night;
I haven't done my lessons!"</p>

<p>"Well, Winnie, this has happened three
or four times within the last week. If
several study bells in school and two
hours in the afternoon are not sufficient
for you to keep up with your classes, I'd
<a class="pagenum" name="page_06" title="6"> </a>
rather you'd go back a year. I want you
to be educated thoroughly, but I can't
have you 'crammed,' and you're too young
to do studying at night."</p>

<p>"Mamma, that is time enough for me
to do all my school work; but, like the
Little Women, I have something to '&#8239;'fess,'
and if you'll let me study this time, I
think that after this I'll get through in
the daytime."</p>

<p>"Very well; but remember, if this is of
frequent occurrence, I'll have to consult
Mr. Bowen and see if you are overworked."</p>

<p>Jack and Mr. Burton had heard none
of this conversation, having gone into the
sitting-room for a game of chess, and
Mrs. Burton and Winnie had remained in
the dining-room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton went into the kitchen to
give her orders for breakfast to Norah,
and Winnie returned to the sitting-room
with a strong determination to work so
hard that she would make up for her self-indulgence
of the afternoon. But little
Ralph came running up to her with:
"Now, 'Innie, tell me a story."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ralphie, Winnie can't to-night;
see, she has to learn something out of all
these books;" and she pointed to the big
pile of them that lay on the table.</p>

<p>"Well, den, me'll wead the newspaper;"
and he sat down on a hassock with a paper
in his hand, and looked so cunning that
Winnie had to go and give him a little hug
before she could get to work.</p>

<p>She began with her greatest bugbear,
United States History; not, however, without
having cast one longing look at "The
Giant Killer," as it stood temptingly on
the edge of the book case. But, saying to
herself, "I'm bound to do it"&mdash;a phrase
which had seemed to help her over difficulties
so many times that she almost felt
as if it were the phrase, and not the exertions
which always followed the use of it,
that was helpful to her&mdash;she applied herself
with such concentration that, during
the twenty minutes her mother remained
out of the room, she learned quite thoroughly
the three pages describing the Battle
of Monmouth. In the meantime,
Ralph had been put to bed, and Mrs. Burton
had come in, cloaked and bonneted.
As soon as their father and mother had
gone, Jack said, "Now, Win, for the new
music."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack, look here! There are two
pages of descriptive geography, ten map
questions, and a short account of the exports
and imports of India to be learned,
and I've six long problems in percentage
to work."</p>

<p>"Whew! Then my cake's dough! But
how is it that you have all this to do to-night?
I thought we were to spend our
evenings in helping and entertaining
each other; that was what I understood
mother to say when she changed your
hour for bed from half past eight to half
past nine. Ah! Win, I know what it is;
you've been at your old tricks, you little
bookworm!"</p>

<p>"Don't tease, Jack. I'm sorry enough
<a class="pagenum" name="page_07" title="7"> </a>
for it now, and I'll be ready to help you
to-morrow night."</p>

<p>"To-morrow! Always to-morrow! But
to-morrow our debating club meets, and
that settles that. I'll have to play without
accompaniment, that's all."</p>

<p>Winnie heaved a sigh. It was a disappointment
to her, too, but she resolutely
forbore to say more about the matter. It
took her, however, until nearly nine
o'clock to learn her geography lesson, and
when her bed-time came, she had but four
of the problems solved. She would much
have liked to remain up an hour longer,
but of direct disobedience Mrs. Burton's
children were seldom guilty, so Winnie
gathered up her books, ready to take to
school in the morning, and went to her
room.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>GOOD RESOLUTIONS.</small></h2>


<div class="floatl">
  <img class="plain" src="images/i07.jpg" width="172" height="226" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap16">
<span class="smcaps"><span class="invisible">W</span>innie</span>
was having a
confused dream of a
little dwarf, armed
with a long column
of figures, which he
waved threateningly
in the air; but as
she advanced to seize
them, thinking to use them for her lessons
during the day, the dwarf commenced to
grow, and, as she stood amazed and horror-struck,
he attained the height of ten
feet or so, and was still growing when
she heard the tinkling of a bell, and a
voice said: "Wizard, avaunt!" At this
the giant disappeared, and the whole column
of figures fell on the floor in a confused
heap. She stooped to pick them
up, when the bell rang again, this time
louder, and she grasped&mdash;her brother
Ralph, who was ringing the breakfast bell
violently in her ears.</p>

<p>A little vexed, she was going to send
him away and turn over for another nap,
when suddenly she remembered her good
resolutions of the evening before, and, to
Ralph's surprise, sprang up at once.</p>

<p>Having dressed herself, she turned the
bedclothes back to air, and, with the exception
of making her bed, which was
done by Norah later in the day, put everything
in her dainty pink room in nice
order. Then she sat down to select her
verse, it being the custom of the family
for each to recite some passage from the
Bible, about which they afterward had a
little talk. She chose part of the second
verse of the sixth chapter of 2d Corinthians:
"Now is the accepted time; now
is the day of salvation."</p>

<p>When the bell rang for the family to
gather, Winnie was ready to go down at
once, without hurry or confusion, or being
haunted by the thought that she was but
half dressed. If she received no other reward,
her mother's approving smile as her
daughter entered, made her feel quite
happy.</p>

<p>Mr. Burton and Jack were not yet
down, but came in almost directly. Her
<a class="pagenum" name="page_08" title="8"> </a>
father read for that morning a part of the
107th Psalm, that most beautiful psalm
of praise and thanksgiving. Then they
all recited their verses. The mother had
chosen hers from the chapter just read:
"For he satisfieth the longing soul, and
filleth the hungry soul with goodness."
Jack had chosen: "Judge not, that ye
be not judged." Ralph said, "Suffer little
children," which was his great standby.
Mr. Burton had a few words to say
about all of them, but about Winnie's in
particular; he spoke about its spiritual and
religions meaning, and went on to say that
it could be applied to all the affairs of life.
He spoke of the folly as well as the sin of
procrastination, that great destroyer of so
many good deeds, which become utterly
useless if done too late. He said that
duties are like bricks used in building a
house; if the foundation stones were left
out, it would be impossible to make any
use of those remaining. After the talk
was finished, the family gathered around
the piano, and sang a morning hymn.</p>

<p>Winnie was in very good spirits that
morning; an approving conscience is a
great help to cheerfulness and good temper.
She cut Ralph's steak for him, and
pleased him very much by begging for one
of his dollars, as she called the tiny cakes
which Norah fried for her pet. She
amused the others, also, by giving, in the
phraseology of a school-girl of to-day, a
graphic account of the way she imagined
the redoubtable Captain Molly acted at
the Battle of Monmouth.</p>

<p>Everything seemed to go well with her,
and at half past eight she had her books
in her arms, ready to take a leisurely stroll
to school, although the unfinished problems
still troubled her.</p>

<p>When she entered her room, three or
four of the girls rushed up to her with:
"Come on into the dressing-room, Win;
we're going to have a meeting of the
B.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;S."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't, girls!" said Winnie, it
must be confessed very faintly, "I've two
more problems to work, and I'll just have
time to do them before the bell rings, and
during the first study bell."</p>

<p>"Oh, bother the problems!" said
Miriam Douglass, striking an attitude.
"Let them go! What are problems,
compared with the important business of
the B.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;S.?"</p>

<p>But Winnie, collecting all her mental
strength, and remembering her "I'm
bound to" of the night before, resolutely
drew back, saying, "I can't, girls; for I've
a giant to kill."</p>

<p>The girls looked at her in amaze.</p>

<p>"A giant to kill! You look as if you'd
kill a dozen, single-handed, you midge!"
laughed tall Miriam, for Winnie was the
youngest and smallest girl in the class.
"Whatever do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I can't stop to tell you now," said
Winnie, "for if I do, I'll lose the first
blow; but I'll tell you about it at recess."</p>

<p>"All right, since you're determined,"
said Fannie Allen; "and I say, girls, let's
postpone our meeting till then."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_09" title="9"> </a>
"Agreed!" said the others; and each
one, as they separated, went to her own
seat and busied herself at some study, so
quickly does a little leaven leaven the
whole.</p>

<p>When recess came, Winnie explained to
the three girls, and Miriam Douglass
laughed at her and teased her not a little;
but somehow no one minded Miriam's
teasing, she was so bright and good-natured
with it all.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Miriam, munching
her last piece of butterscotch&mdash;for be it
known that the mysterious initials, about
which the other girls of the class were
"dancing crazy with curiosity," as Miriam
said, signified "Butter Scotch Society"&mdash;"you'll
be wanting us to give
up the B.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;S. with all its sweet delights,
and go about the world with drawn
swords, and 'front like Jove, to threaten
or command,' neither giving nor receiving
quarter. I can see myself now, as I exclaim,
'Base spirit, beware, lest with this
trusty sword I hew thee in pieces!'" And
she flourished her ruler with such spirit
that the girls all applauded. Just then,
however, the bell rang for the close of recess,
and they were obliged to go to their
recitations.</p>

<p>Thanks to Winnie's determination, and
her vigorous use of the study bells, she
received a perfect mark in all her lessons
for the day, but she went home in the afternoon
tired and jaded from the hard
work.</p>

<p>She found her mother in the sitting-room,
sewing, and said, as she threw down
her books, "Now, mamma, I want to
make my confession, and also to thank
you for allowing me to work last night.
I know you have often spoken to me about
my bad habit of putting everything off
till the last minute, and it is almost always
because I get hold of a story book
and cannot lay it down. Yesterday it was
'The Giant Killer,' and I was so interested
in Fides' battle with Giant Hate, that I
forgot I was neglecting my own faults to
watch him conquer his. But now I'm going
to begin killing my own giants, and
I'll commence with my worst, procrastination;
for indeed, as Miss Brownlow is always
telling us, it is the thief of time.
And I want you to watch me and help me.
As to-morrow will be Saturday, I want to
get every one of my lessons for Monday,
so that I can use the Monday study bells
for Tuesday's lessons; then I can always
get through in the afternoon."</p>

<p>"I think that will be a very good plan,
Winnie; you will then feel at ease each
day about the work for the succeeding
one, and an absence of worry will keep
your mental faculties in good condition,
so that you can do much more work with
less strain of mind or body. And it will
leave your evenings for reading or such
other recreation as may occur from time
to time, for you know I do not believe in
all work and no play. I want to run down
to Shillito's now to do a little shopping,
and I hope you will be able, while I am
gone, to resist your favorite temptation,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_10" title="10"> </a>
for I really believe that many of our
temptations are favorites."</p>

<p>As soon as Mrs. Burton, taking Ralph
with her, had gone, Winnie settled herself
resolutely to work at her problems. She
had just become quite interested in finding
out the "population of a certain village,"
which increased a certain per cent,
the first year, etc., when the bell rang, and
answering the call, she found Miriam
Douglass. Here was a dilemma. But she
said:</p>

<p>"Miriam, I'm just at work on my
problems for Monday. Come right in,
and we'll work them together."</p>

<p>"Oh, Winnie, we'll have all day to-morrow
to get our lessons. Do let's have
a good time to-day."</p>

<p>"I promised mamma that I would do
all my lessons before Monday, but, of
course, Miriam, if you don't wish to, I'll
stop. I do think, though, that we'll enjoy
ourselves just as well if we do this
work."</p>

<p>"All right, Winnie, go ahead," said
Miriam laughing. "I guess my brain can
stand it if yours can."</p>

<p>The two girls applied themselves so
well, Miriam being particularly bright in
arithmetic, that by the time Mrs. Burton
returned, they not only had the whole set
of problems solved, but neatly copied and
ready to "hand in."</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton herself helped them with
their analysis in grammar, and that being
Miriam's great stumbling block, she was
delighted with the assistance. She accepted
Mrs. Burton's invitation to stay to
supper, after which, Mr. Burton and Jack
both being out, Winnie's mother proposed
that the girls should take turns reading
aloud to her from the book Winnie had
been telling them about.</p>

<p>Both girls had been well taught, and it
was a pleasure to listen to their fresh, well
modulated voices. Miriam, though far
less imaginative than Winnifred, enjoyed
the book very much, and said, half in fun:</p>

<p>"Why can't we turn our B.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;S. into
a club to fight our giants? We might
then be a help instead of a drawback to
each other, as I know we are now, for
we're always upsetting each other's attempts
to do right."</p>

<p>"I think that is a very good idea," said
Mrs. Burton. "Union and organization
are such powers in this world, that I do
not see why they should not help four little
girls to do right. You might have
social meetings occasionally to report progress,
and you could have a good time beside.
Talk it over on Monday with Gretta
and Fannie, and if you want help, come
to me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Burton, you always do think
of the nicest things! That's just what we
will do, and we'll report a week from to-night.
But now it is time for me to go."</p>

<p>As Miriam lived only a square away,
Mrs. Burton and Winnie walked over with
her, and on their return Winnie went to
bed happy and contented.</p>

<p class="dropcap16">
<span class="smcaps"><span class="invisible">O</span>n the</span>
following Monday
at recess, Miriam
called a meeting
of the B.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;S., and
she and Winnie told
the other two girls
what they were
thinking of doing.
But it was very hard
work to make
Gretta Berger understand.</p>

<p>"Giants!" said she, "what do we care
for giants? We're no longer little children,
that we should believe in such
things."</p>

<p>"But don't you believe that we have
faults that we ought to try to conquer?"
said Winnie.</p>

<p>"Faults! You'd think I had a million,
if you'd hear my mother lecture me; and
my sister Josephine seems to think I
never did do anything right. I never suit
either of them. I'm scolded from Monday
morning till Saturday night, and I
don't want all my play-time taken up in
the same way."</p>

<p>"Oh, Gretta, who is going to scold you?
I'm sure we'll all have enough to do to
watch over our own faults, without talking
to you of yours."</p>

<p>"Didn't you say we were to help each
other? How can we do that, if we don't
say anything when one of us does wrong?
No, let our teachers and parents and big
sisters do that. I'm sure they seem to enjoy
it well enough."</p>

<p>"Enjoy it! Well, I'm sure we can't
blame them. I don't know how else they
are to get even with you, when you never
give in half your demerits for the day, and
sit and sulk for half an hour if you're told
to stop talking," said Miriam, with her
usual heedlessness.</p>

<p>"Well. I'm not so lazy that I can't pin
my collar on straight and clean my finger
nails; and as for killing giants, I think
we'd better be eating fruit and taffy than
getting into a fuss by meddling with
other folks' affairs!" And Gretta flounced
off in high dudgeon.</p>

<p>Winnie's eyes filled with tears. All this
was so unlike anything she had imagined,
and now they had gotten into a quarrel
the very first thing.</p>

<p>"Let her go, Winnie," said Fannie;
"she's always getting into the sulks, and
her father's nothing but a music teacher,
anyhow. I never could see why you girls
liked her so much. I'm sure I never did."</p>

<p>"No!" said Miriam sarcastically, "we
can't all be the handsome daughter of a
wealthy and celebrated lawyer, more's the
pity!"</p>

<p>Winnie's heart sank lower. How she
wished she had tried to do right herself,
and let the other girls alone! Now Fannie
would be angry, too.</p>

<p>But, to her surprise, Fannie laughed
outright. "This is too absurd for anything,
girls. Here we were just about to
sweep the world before us, and now we've
<a class="pagenum" name="page_12" title="12"> </a>
had our first quarrel for over a month. As
for me, I know I'm proud and vain, and I
do like my friends to be rich and distinguished.
But papa says it isn't exactly
well-bred to choose our friends on such a
basis, and he calls my pride silly, and tells
me not to be a&mdash;well, yes, he does&mdash;a
snob. But I like to be proud. Perhaps,
though, someone else beside myself
knows something, and I'll be glad to join,
and will try to like it when my toes are
stepped on."</p>

<p>"Well," said Miriam, "I'm sure I beg
your pardon, if I hurt the toes. But I
think your good-nature got the best of it.
As for Gretta, you all know she'll sulk just
so long, anyhow, and when she gets tired
of it, she'll be all right; and if she once
gets this thing through her somewhat
thick head, she'll want to join, too."</p>

<p>"My! but there's a lot of work before
us! Do you know, girls, I actually lay
awake for an hour last night, wondering
what faults I had, and now, since this
squabble, I've seen signs of half a dozen.
It's taken all the starch out of me. Don't
I look limp?" And Miriam hung her
hands and arms so nervelessly and assumed
such a vapid expression, that Fannie
laughed outright, and Winnie smiled
through her tears.</p>

<p>"Well, there's one bad habit that we all
have," said she decidedly. "We're always
saying, 'in a minute,' or 'by and by,' or
'to-morrow.' I don't believe we'll get
angry with each other over that, for it
isn't what my father would call 'a personal
peculiarity.'" Winnie did like to
use big words.</p>

<p>"All right, Winnie, we'll all begin together,
and you shall be the captain of our
first expedition against the foe."</p>

<p>Winnie went home somewhat comforted,
but still quite unhappy about
Gretta. She longed to tell her mother all
that had happened, but Mrs. Burton was
entertaining callers, and she was therefore
obliged to restrain her impatience.</p>

<p>On Tuesdays there were fewer recitations
for her class than on other days, and,
having made good use of her study bells,
she was quite through before five o'clock,
and concluded to take Ralph out for a
walk, so she called her mother to ask permission.
Mrs. Burton was quite willing,
and said she might also go to the library
and change her book. Then she returned
to her guests.</p>

<p>Winnie ran to ask Norah if she would
help get Ralph ready. She found her in
the wooden rocking-chair in the cheerful
kitchen, reading the "Commercial Gazette,"
and "taking it easy," as she called
it. Winnie made her request in a very
peremptory manner. Norah looked at
her a minute, and then said: "So you
want me to dress Ralph, do you? Well, I
guess that want will have to be your master,
for I don't intend to break my back
over the wash-tub all day, and, when I'm
snatching a moment for rest, be at the
beck and call of a sassy little girl." So
saying, Norah returned to her newspaper,
completely ignoring Winnie's presence.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_13" title="13"> </a>
Winnifred knew that it would be utterly
useless to say anything more; besides, she
had been reproved by her mother more
than once for her way of speaking to
Norah. But she was greatly disappointed,
for now she would either have to take
Ralph dressed as he was, or leave him at
home. She finally concluded to do the
former, so, hastily getting Ralph and herself
into their coats, they were soon in the
street car.</p>

<p>Ralph, as usual, had numberless questions
to ask. When they reached Fountain
Square, they got out, and Winnie, as
she invariably did when down town,
crossed to the Esplanade to look at the
fountain, of which she never wearied.
Ralph said he liked to see the little boys
and girls sprinkling, and then he must
have a drink from the little boy with a
shell in his hand.</p>

<p>All this took up time, so that when they
reached the public library it was quite
late. The delivery room, as usual at that
hour, was crowded, and, having handed
in her card and list, Winnie sat down on
one of the benches to wait till her number
was called. This took so long that Ralph
became restless and then sleepy, and when
they were finally in the car on their way
home, he soon closed his eyes. Winnie
knew that she would have her hands full
if he went to sleep, so she shook him, saying,
"Ralphie, Ralphie, don't you know
that you mustn't go to sleep?"</p>

<p>"Me isn't s'eepy!" said the little fellow,
poking his chubby fingers into his eyes to
keep them open; but, finding it quite hard
work, after a minute's consideration he
added, "But there's somefin in my eyes,
'ough."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ralph, that's the Sandman; you
mustn't let him throw sand in your eyes
in the street car!"</p>

<p>"No, me 'on't," said Ralph, making a
desperate effort.</p>

<p>This little conversation seemed greatly
to amuse an old gentleman opposite. He
took Ralph on his knee and let him play
with his watch, and kindly kept him
awake until it was time for the children to
get out.</p>

<p>When they reached home they found
the family, with the addition of their
grandma, Aunt Kitty and Uncle Fred, all
at supper, laughing and talking in the
happiest manner imaginable. Winnie
was delighted. Aunt Kitty was the dearest
to her of all her aunts. She was
young and gay and good-natured, always
ready to join in a frolic, or to help with
one's lessons, or to take the children and
the children's visitors to the "zoo" or the
park or some other place equally delightful.</p>

<p>After supper they went into the sitting-room,
and Winnie and Jack played their
last duet, which Aunt Kitty complimented
quite highly. She said to Mr.
Burton, "Winnie does so nicely with her
music that I hope you'll allow her to make
more of it soon. If she goes to the high-school
next year, she'll have more time to
practice, won't she?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_14" title="14"> </a>
"Yes, I think so," interrupted Uncle
Fred. "She'll be putting on long dresses,
and practicing the airs of a young lady
before the glass. But she won't imitate
you, Kitty; your ways will be too youthful
for her by that time," and he gave Winnie's
braid a pull. "Isn't it singular?"
he continued meditatively. "Here Winnie
will be growing older every year, and
Kitty just the reverse. I don't think she'll
have another birthday in ten years."</p>

<p>"Most assuredly not, if you'll tell me
the way to avoid it. Winnie can have my
birthdays and her own, too," laughed
Aunt Kitty.</p>

<p>If there was one thing in the world
that Winnie resented as an indignity,
it was having her ears tweaked, and
now she burst out:</p>

<p>"Grandma, do make Uncle Fred stop!
I think he ought to have a good scolding."</p>

<p>"Why, he's my baby," said grandma;
"you wouldn't have me scold my baby,
would you?"</p>

<p>Winnie's expression at the novel idea
of teasing Uncle Fred's being anybody's
baby was one of such amazement that they
all laughed, though Winnie herself hardly
appreciated the joke.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Uncle Fred, slipping
a bag of chocolates into her hands as
a peace-offering, "you know I must tease
someone, and your Aunt Kitty is more invulnerable
than Achilles himself, for I
think that even her heel was dipped."</p>

<p>"Oh, I have a vulnerable point,"
laughed Aunt Kitty, though a close observer
might have noticed a queer little
sober look about her eyes and mouth,
"and it is this"&mdash;putting one of Winnifred's
creams into her mouth: "the absolute
cruelty of giving someone else a paper
of chocolates while I'm present. By the
way, Winnie, let's go into the kitchen and
make some taffy, while my mother instructs
your mother how to bring up children
in the way they should go; for that
she knows how to do it, witness your
Uncle Fred and myself as bright and shining
examples."</p>

<p>But for once Winnie held back. At
last she said: "Norah won't like it;
she's cross to-day. She wouldn't help me
get Ralph ready to go down town."</p>

<p>"Oh, Winnie, I'm afraid you've been at
your old tricks. But come on; I'll manage
Norah, and she has probably forgiven
you before this."</p>

<p>This proved to be the case, and Norah,
who was very fond of Aunt Kitty, was so
good-natured, not even grumbling about
the "muss," that Winnie felt as if she
were having coals of fire heaped on her
head; and, not to be outdone in generosity,
contritely begged Norah's pardon for
the way she had spoken to her in the
afternoon.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>A RAINY DAY.</small></h2>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="indent0"><a class="pagenum" name="page_15" title="15"> </a>
dictated Miriam to a group of girls in the
school-room, who were "cramming" for
the February examination, and who had
hurried back at dinner time for that purpose.</p>

<p>"What a queer jumble that makes!"
said Winnie. "I believe I'd rather copy
it from the book. Don't you think that
last line's odd?&mdash;'Do not strive to grasp
them all.' I thought that was just what
we ought to do, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I asked Miss Brownlow that question
yesterday," said Ernestine Alroy, a tall,
pale and thoughtful-looking girl, "and
she said that Miss Procter didn't mean
that we were to let any of them go, but
that we are not to try to seize them all
at once; that it would be like anything
else&mdash;if our hands were too full, we'd be
sure to drop something. She said we
must take this 'Memory Gem' in connection
with the motto on the board, 'Do the
duty that lies nearest thee,' and that if we
followed the advice in both of them, we'd
be sure not to let any of our duties go
undone."</p>

<p>"Ernestine, you always did like to
preach," said Josie Thompson, making a
wry face over the pickle she was eating.
"I think it's quite bad enough to have to
learn Memory Gems, with all the hideous
punctuation, and expect to stand an examination&mdash;and
they always pick out the
one you know the least about&mdash;with five
per cent. off for a comma left out or put
in the wrong place, ten for a misspelled
word, and so on until, by the time my
'Gems' are corrected, there's no per cent.
left at all. I say all this is bad enough,
without having to understand and explain
them." And she stopped to take breath,
quite exhausted by her long speech.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, if you troubled yourself a
little more about the meaning, you'd get
higher marks occasionally," said Miriam.</p>

<p>"Oh, who cares for marks anyhow?
I'm getting sick of the eternal word
'Duty!' Miss Brownlow never misses an
occasion to make use of it. Then we're
always learning some selection with the
same word in it, and now you girls have
taken it up and there's no knowing if you
will ever stop. As for me, I'm going to
enjoy myself while I'm young. I guess
I'll live just as long, if I don't worry myself
to death."</p>

<p>The brighter girls laughed, and Miriam
said, with quick mimicry, "I think you
will live just as long, if you don't worry
yourself to death. What a speech! Well,
I think you're right; you'll live forever, if
worry is the only thing that can kill."</p>

<p>"Well, laugh as much as you please;
you can all plod along, if you want to. I'm
going to have a good time."</p>

<p>"It is hard, though," said Winnie,
plaintively; "it's much nicer to do the
things we like to do than those we ought
to do, especially when none of us want to
do things that are very wrong."</p>

<p>"It's harder to catch up," said Ernestine,
"than to keep straight on; and I
think if we'd all pray for help not to
neglect our duties, we'd find it easier."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_16" title="16"> </a>
None of the girls laughed at this, for
Ernestine was so devoted to her ideas of
religion, and so brave in the profession of
them, that if she thought it was her duty,
she would have knelt down right there
and prayed aloud for them all.</p>

<p>"Well, this isn't learning the 'Gem,'"
said Fannie Allen decisively; and then for
a few moments nothing was heard but the
scratching of pencils, as Miriam went on
dictating:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent0">"One by one thy duties wait thee,</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">Let thy whole strength go to each,</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">Let no future dreams elate thee,</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">Learn thou first what these can teach."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>After the bell had rung for school to
commence, the afternoon wore dismally
away. A steady, drenching rain was
pouring down as if it intended never to
stop. Under the circumstances there
could be no recess, which added to the
general feeling of weariness, restlessness
and disgust.</p>

<p>Each recitation was a recapitulation,
which made the more studious or those
with the better memories feel as if there
were "nothing new under the sun," and
gave to the triflers, or those to whom study
was a continual climbing of the "Hill
Difficulty," a confused impression of hearing
something they had heard before, but
failed to remember just when or where or
how.</p>

<p>To add to the discomfort, there was
much copying to be done from the blackboard,
and, as it was dark and gloomy,
there was a complaint of not being able
to see, until the front seats were filled
with a crowd of tired, discontented girls,
with their young faces puckered up into
all sorts of frowns and grimaces. Even
the best-natured among the teachers were
conscious of an utter failure to keep from
showing irritation, and they were made to
sigh for a royal road both to learning and
to teaching. It was with a general sigh
of relief that the bell announcing the
hour of dismission was heard.</p>

<p>But the discomfort was not yet over.
The halls and dressing-rooms were filled
with an odor of wet wool and rubber; rain-cloaks
and rubbers were confusedly mixed,
and Miss Brownlow reminded the complainers,
in a most irritating manner, of
the number of times she had urged them
all to mark their gossamers and overshoes,
and positively forbade them to expect any
interference from her if anything were
lost. Then some of the girls ran down
stairs, and all were ordered back; and, it
being impossible to distinguish the culprits,
the innocent suffered with the
guilty, so that it was nearly five o'clock
before they were finally allowed to descend
the stairs, and they had been hearing
the exasperating shouts of freedom
from the boys under the windows for a
full half hour.</p>

<p>Miriam and Winnie, walking home under
the same umbrella, felt their desire to
be good and the courage to strive for it,
at the lowest ebb. Winnie said petulantly,
"I wish there were no such thing
as school! It's dig, dig, dig, and then it's
cram, cram, cram, until, at last, you don't
<a class="pagenum" name="page_17" title="17"> </a>
know whether you know anything or not!
I'm just sick of it!"</p>

<p>"You'd feel more disagreeable if you'd
lost the third pair of
rubbers this winter,
and had wet feet. I
don't see why it is that
it's always my rubbers
that are gone, anyway.
Mamma will say that I
grow more heedless
every day of my life;
that I never will learn
to take care of anything;
and will wonder
if I think papa
is a millionaire. I
wish now that I'd
marked that last pair
of rubbers."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! It's so
hard to do right, and
not to feel hateful and
cross. Everyone seems
to get cross but Ernestine.
But then, none
of the rest are as good
as she is. I don't believe
she ever feels
like doing wrong; and
she always seems happy,
too; not peevish or sulky like the rest
of us. Do you suppose&mdash;"</p>

<p>But just then, too absorbed to notice
where they were going, they ran against
an old gentleman, and their umbrella was
knocked out of their hands into the gutter,
where, of course, it was soon all wet
and muddy.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="images/i17.jpg" width="483" height="650" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">Too absorbed to notice where they were going.</p>
</div>

<p>Then the old gentleman sputtered and
scolded, and said he wished little girls
would look where they were going once in
a while, and that they were nothing but
"giggling nuisances" anyhow. Then
Miriam dropped her books, and, as both
she and Winnie stooped to pick them up,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_18" title="18"> </a>
they knocked their heads together with
such force that tears sprang to the eyes of
both.</p>

<p>As a usual thing, such occurrences
would have made them laugh, but they
were far enough from being "giggling
nuisances" on this occasion, and when
they turned the corner and separated, it
would not have been easy to find two
muddier or crosser little girls, while both,
I fear, had forgotten all about the giants
they were intending to fight.</p>

<p>When Winnie reached home, she spoke
to Ralph so crossly, when he ran up to
her for a kiss, that his lips trembled and
he turned to Mrs. Burton, saying, "Mamma,
is me bad? 'Innie 'ouldn't tiss me!"</p>

<p>Winnie, at sight of his grieved face,
began to feel ashamed of herself, but was
still too cross to make any acknowledgments,
and, without saying a word, went
up to her room to change her muddy
dress.</p>

<p>When she came down, Mrs. Burton
looked at her searchingly, but asked no
questions, and it was not until after supper
that Winnie felt sufficiently herself to
tell her mother about the disagreeable afternoon.
Mrs. Burton only said: "Well,
Winnie,&mdash;</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class="indent0">but I hope my daughter isn't going to
grow up into one of those unpleasant
women who always make it disagreeable
for other people when things do not turn
out just as they would like to have them."</p>




<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>THE FIRST MEETING.</small></h2>


<div class="floatl">
  <img class="plain" src="images/i18.jpg" width="172" height="207" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap27">
<span class="smcaps"><span class="invisible">A</span>s a consequence</span>
of the lost rubbers
and wet feet, Miriam
caught such a
cold that she was
not able to leave the
house for the remainder
of the
week. Gretta Burger was still sulking,
and Fannie Allen was, as she said, "reviewing
odds and ends," so the meeting
which was to have been held on Friday of
that week was postponed.</p>

<p>But fickleness and inconstancy of purpose
were not among the faults of Winnifred,
and although she made many failures,
and the words "by and by" and
"in a minute" were frequently on her
lips, she nevertheless made some progress
in conquering her great fault.</p>

<p>Her greatest temptation, as is evident
from what has already been seen of her,
was to let everything else go and slip off
into some nook and lose herself in what
she called "a delicious read." And this
habit was all the harder for her to break
because she had commenced it when she
was a very little girl, and it had then
looked "so cunning" and studious that
injudicious friends and acquaintances of
the family, unable to distinguish between
a love for study which costs hard work
and self-denial, and a mere love for narrative
which is easily gratified, had
praised her when she was within hearing,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_19" title="19"> </a>
and had told Mr. Burton how much they
envied him the possession of so studious
and intelligent a child. Not that all
works of fiction are to be condemned, for
they often have a good and lasting influence,
and become a decided factor in the
formation of a noble character. But like
all things intended for recreation, they
should be used only at the proper time.
Winnie was fast finding out that the
proper time was when her daily duties
were over, and that was reducing her two
or three snatched hours a day to fifteen or
twenty minutes. She was also beginning
to find out the close connection between
various bad habits. She saw that procrastination
led to carelessness, disobedience,
and, in some natures, to untruthfulness
and dishonesty.</p>

<p>But by the following Friday, the long-anticipated
examination was over. Our
four little friends had reason to be well
satisfied with the result, so far as they
were personally concerned. A mutual
content had restored harmony between
Gretta and the other three, and they had
decided to hold their first meeting on that
evening.</p>

<p>Winnie was very anxious to have Ernestine
come, too; but, although she laughed
at herself for her foolish pride, Fannie
said: "Of course we know Ernestine is a
nice girl, but we don't know anything
about her family, and you know she never
speaks of her father, although nobody ever
heard that he is dead. They may be very
common people, for all we know."</p>

<p>Winnie was greatly troubled about this,
for she did not like "common people"
very well herself. She had her own ideas
about such things, and she called Althea
Browne "common." Althea wore brass
jewelry, and was always boasting about the
fine things they had at home, and the
grand parties her aunt in Virginia gave.
She was always willing to accept fruits
and sweetmeats from the other girls, but
had been known, more than once, to sneak
off by herself and munch candies and apples
which she had brought. Winnie
thought that if Ernestine's people were
like Althea, she did not want to have anything
to do with them.</p>

<p>As usual, she carried this perplexity to
her mother, who said: "Let the matter
rest for the present, dear. While Fannie
feels as she does about it, it would not be
pleasant for any of you to have her come,
or for Ernestine herself, and dissension
will not help you to become better. In
the meantime I will consider the matter,
and, if I conclude that it will be best for
Ernestine to join you, I hope to be able to
arrange it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton had invited the three girls
to take supper with Winnie, and, as school
had closed early, and they had no lessons
to prepare for Monday, they had a nice,
long afternoon together. Miriam read
aloud the account of the combat of Fides
with the Giant Sloth, and when she was
through, said: "That is the giant Gretta
pointed out to me; and a hard one he will
be for me to overcome, I can tell you."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_20" title="20"> </a>
"What is my worst one?" asked Fannie,
taking up the book which Miriam had
laid down. As she glanced through the
pages she said, with a slight blush, "Oh,
yes; my father would tell me that I must
conquer my pride, and he tries to have
me see how disagreeable it makes me, by
telling me that I will never be a perfect
lady until I have done so. Here, Miriam,
read this aloud, too; you make it so plain
that I almost feel as if I were there."</p>

<p>Gretta said very little, but she had a
self-satisfied air about her, as if it
were as needless for anyone to be proud
or untidy as for anyone to steal, and she
felt herself far removed from faults such
as these. And indeed she was neither indolent
nor untidy. She rose at six&mdash;that
magic hour in which Fides was to strike
his first blow at Giant Sloth&mdash;and practiced
two hours before school; she was
neatness itself, both in person and in
all her belongings. Besides, she was
neither so conscientious as Winnie, so
frank and outspoken as Fannie, nor so
easily influenced, either for right or
wrong, as Miriam. So her conscience lay
dormant.</p>

<p>She was, however, conscious that she,
too, had a habit of not doing things as
soon as she ought, and to try to overcome
that seemed to her almost like a lesson to
be learned, so she was willing to try to
learn it with the others.</p>

<p>After Miriam had finished the chapter,
Winnie said, "Oh, girls, I must show you
my autographs;" and, turning to Ralph,
who sat by the window, gazing intently at
a couple of puppies which were having a
romp together, she said, "Ralphie, bring
Winnie that book by the window."</p>

<p>Without moving a muscle of his chubby
little body, or even turning his head, the
child answered: "You just s'pect me to
do evvyfing; I tan't do evvyfing."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ralph, my little partner in distress!"
exclaimed Miriam, in her most
dramatic way, snatching him up and kissing
him in spite of his struggles. "You'll
have to have a suit of armor, too. Who
would have thought that one so young
could be so lazy!"</p>

<p>The laugh was not yet over when Mrs.
Burton came in, with her pleasant smile,
saying, "Girls, I've a short story to tell
you&mdash;that is, if you wish to hear it; and
there'll just be time before supper."</p>

<p>Of course they were delighted, and,
Fannie having coaxed Ralph to her lap,
they all gathered around Mrs. Burton,
making a pretty group in their unconsciously
graceful attitudes, as they listened
to the following narrative:</p>

<p>"Constance van Orten was born in New
York, a descendant of one of the old
Knickerbocker families, but of a branch
which had preserved more of the family
pride than its estates. Money, however,
was not altogether lacking, and to many
people their income would have seemed
sumptuous; but to them, in comparison
with their more wealthy friends and relatives,
it seemed the merest pittance that
necessity could demand.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_21" title="21"> </a>
"But this comparative lack of money
never troubled little Constance, and fortune
seemed to smile upon her. One
might almost have believed that all the
beneficent fairies had presided at her
birth, so many graces of face and form
and disposition were hers, and so many of
the conditions necessary to human happiness
seemed fulfilled in her lot.</p>

<p>"She was the youngest child and only
daughter, and her four brothers found her
so charming a plaything, and later so
agreeable a companion, that they took
pleasure in making her life a succession
of pleasant surprises, and her every wish
was gratified almost before expressed. Indeed,
had she asked for the moon, it would
have been a source of genuine grief to
them that they could not get it for her.</p>

<p>"Pain seemed as far removed from her
as anxiety or grief, for, although she had
an odd faculty of catching all the diseases
incident to childhood, they touched her so
lightly that it was seldom necessary to call
in a physician. If she received a cut or a
wound of any kind, so pure was her blood
and so perfect her physical condition that
it healed as if by magic.</p>

<p>"Her willfulness was extreme, as might
have been expected from the almost total
lack of restraint under which she grew up;
but so winning were her ways, and so
ready her repentance for her little misdeeds,
that for the most part she escaped
punishment and even reproof.</p>

<p>"Almost without the power of application,
she seemed to pick up external evidences
of education and culture without
effort. She talked fluently, sang charmingly,
and, having almost marvelous tact,
never failed to please.</p>

<p>"Being, as I have said, the only daughter,
she entered society earlier than most
girls, and, in spite of her comparative lack
of means, soon became a reigning belle.
During her first season she refused more
than one wealthy suitor, and that, too, to
the intense satisfaction of her parents and
brothers, for she was a veritable sunbeam
in the family, and they looked forward
with dread to the thought of losing her.</p>

<p>"At last, however, there came, furnished
with letters of introduction to one
of Constance's uncles, a young and
wealthy cotton planter from Louisiana.
His seeming indifference to money and his
prodigal use of it, his pleasant speech and
manner, his languid Southern movements,
so different from those of the brisk
Northerners to whom they were accustomed,
and, above all, the very fact of his
being a stranger, made him most welcome
to the girlish minds so fond of change and
novelty. But it was with the greatest regret
that the Van Ortens began to notice
his marked attentions to Constance and
the increasing pleasure she took in them.
It was not only that a marriage with him
would separate her from them all, but her
father and brothers, constantly meeting
the young stranger at clubs and places
where there were no ladies present, and
consequently where he was off his guard,
found him capricious and changeable in
<a class="pagenum" name="page_22" title="22"> </a>
his opinions and actions, extremely self-indulgent,
selfishly indifferent to the comfort
of others, and so fond of intoxicating
liquor that, on more than one occasion, he
had been directly and shamefully under
its influence.</p>

<p>"But Constance would not, perhaps
could not, see him in the light in which
he was portrayed to her, and, in spite of
all their warnings and her mother's pleadings,
she consented to become his wife.
Immediately after the marriage, they went
to Louisiana, and for awhile all was to
Constance as her most ardent fancy had
painted it. Their home was in the beautiful
Claiborne Parish, which has been
named "the Eden of Louisiana." Her
winning ways and delicate beauty endeared
her to the new acquaintances she
formed, and made her the idol of the
slaves on the plantation. Here two sons
were born, and the mother felt her happiness
complete. But presently she found
her husband less attentive to her. He absented
himself on long journeys, for
which he scarcely had a pretext, and
when at home was either sullen or irritable.</p>

<p>"Then the Civil War broke out and he
lost much of his property, and there were
almost ceaseless and taunting allusions on
his part to the "plebeian Yankees" and
the ruin they had brought him. After the
close of the war, however, he seemed to
make an effort to do the best with what
property remained. He became a little
more considerate, and sometimes seemed
to be almost what he had been in the early
years of his married life, and when Constance
became the mother of a little girl,
she began to feel as if, after all, life might
hold some good in store for her.</p>

<p>"But alas! her husband's good behavior
did not last long. He began to
drink constantly, and at last he left one
morning, without saying a word, and
never returned. Then the two promising
boys died of that dreadful scourge, yellow
fever, and Constance was almost heartbroken.</p>

<p>"During the war, communication with
her New York relatives had been almost
impossible, and since then, as is usual in
interrupted correspondence, even among
those who love each other best, it had assumed
a desultory character; and now that
Constance felt overwhelmingly disgraced
by her husband's desertion, and knowing
that all this sorrow had come upon her in
consequence of her opposition to the
wishes of her family, she was too proud to
turn to them for help or comfort. But to
remain where she was was likewise almost
an impossibility, for the scenes of sorrow
through which she had passed made the
South a hated prison from which she felt
that she must escape. Besides, her husband's
creditors had seized upon everything
that was left, and the once lovely,
petted girl, destitute, bereaved, forsaken,
raised what money she could from the sale
of her laces and jewelry, and, taking passage
in one of the Mississippi steamers,
started for Louisville. There, however,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_23" title="23"> </a>
she remained but a few days, and finally
came to Cincinnati, hoping here to find
some way to support herself and her little
daughter, without being obliged to appeal
to her brothers for help.</p>

<p>"But for a woman reared as she had
been, what was there to do? Her slender
means became still more slender, and it
was only after having been subjected to
absolute privation, that she managed to
obtain a place in a store as saleswoman,
and now she and her child are able to live
respectably, if not always comfortably.
Her one joy and source of happiness she
finds in the companionship of her daughter
Ernestine, a girl of character so fine
and religious principles so high that they
would be a credit to one of twice her
years."</p>

<p>"Why, that sounds like a description of
Ernestine Alroy!" said Fannie.</p>

<p>"And it is Ernestine of whom I am
speaking, although I hope it is not necessary
for me to suggest that she would not
like her mother's history to be made public
property. In fact, I must earnestly
request you not to mention it even in your
own homes," said Mrs. Burton. "It was
only by a mere accident that I heard this
narrative yesterday afternoon. But I
hear Mr. Burton and Jack in the hall, and,
as supper will be served in a very few minutes,
I must leave you, with an apology
for telling you a sad story, and one which
I would not have ventured upon had it
not been an 'o'er true tale.'"</p>

<p>"How dreadful!" said Fannie. "And
to think, girls, that her mother was as
happy and well reared&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just then, however, supper was announced,
and Fannie's sentence remained
unfinished.</p>

<p>After supper, Jack brought out his violin,
and he and Gretta played some duets
together, Gretta reading the piano part at
sight, and so well that Winnie felt her
own poor little talent cast quite in the
shade.</p>

<p>Then Gretta played some pretty sonatinas
with fine taste and expression, and
gave so much pleasure to her listeners that
Fannie began to think there might be
worse things in the world than being a
"music teacher's daughter."</p>

<p>After that, to the great delight of the
girls, Mr. Burton sang, in his fine bass
voice, and with the merry twinkle in his
eyes in accord with his extravagant gestures,
a comic song, ending with a little
refrain in which all the Burtons, not even
excepting Ralph, joined, the latter singing
at the top of his voice, and clapping his
hands for accompaniment.</p>

<p>They had hardly had time to feel weary
of sitting still and listening, when Mrs.
Burton had them all in the dining-room
playing the good old game of "Puss in the
Corner." Here, too, Mr. Burton distinguished
himself by his pathetic appeals
for a "corner." The game left them all
breathless but happy, and they sat down
for awhile to recover themselves and "cool
off," while Jack went to get on his overcoat
preparatory to seeing the girls home.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY.</small></h2>


<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_24" title="24"> </a></p>

<div class="floatl">

</div>

<p class="dropcap16">
<span class="smcaps"><span class="invisible">T</span>he</span>
school which Winnie
and her friends
attended was in the
habit of selecting
certain authors,
whose birthday anniversaries
they commemorated. This
year, however, the principal had concluded
to celebrate Washington's birthday
by patriotic songs, declamations, and
so on. In consequence the pupils were
all in a state of great excitement, pleasurable
to boyish and girlish hearts.</p>

<p>Lessons were shortened, classes dismissed
early, rehearsals conducted morning,
noon and night. From one end of
the building to the other, "spouting"
was heard, gestures were being made in
the most frantic manner, the strains of
"The Star Spangled Banner," "America,"
and "The Red, White and Blue"
rose upon the air; and, as the crowds of
boys and girls passed to and from school,
their conversation contained allusions to
"The Father of our Country," or the fine
way in which Harry or Tom or Frank
gave that declamation, or the sweetness of
Mabel Gray's voice, or why Mr. Bowen
hadn't selected Clarence instead of Bob,
etc., etc., etc., until all the air around the
school-house must have been as heavily
charged with patriotism as the air around
Lexington on the morning of that memorable
battle which, too, was talked of, for
there had been much "brushing up" of
United States history.</p>

<p>The memorable day of the 21st of February
arrived (there being no school on
the 22d), and found the rooms finely decorated
with flags and swords and battle
relics, portraits of George and Martha
Washington, and flowers and living
plants, while the blackboards were entirely
filled with ornamental scrolls containing
patriotic mottoes.</p>

<p>Two o'clock had been set for the beginning
of the programme, but long before
that time visitors had begun to arrive and
were shown to seats by the two gentlemanly
boy-ushers in quite an impressive
manner.</p>

<p>Among the visitors, our friends the
Burtons, not excepting Ralph, were represented.
Ralph sat snuggled up to his
mother, his big eyes having their most
pleased and wondering look. Mrs. Alroy,
too, was there, dressed quietly but tastefully,
and looking a perfect lady; having
indeed so thoroughbred an air that even
Fannie's somewhat haughty mamma who
sat next her, could scarcely equal her.</p>

<p>Gretta Berger took her place at the
piano, and soon the inspiring strains of a
patriotic medley were heard, while the
boys and girls from the various rooms
marched into the hall and took their
places with such a fine idea of time and
military precision of movement that to see
them was not the least pleasure of the afternoon.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_25" title="25"> </a>
The next thing on the programme was
a sketch of George Washington's life, by
Ernestine Alroy, read by her in a sweet,
dignified way, in a well-modulated voice,
and an expression which showed a thorough
appreciation of the fine character
and life she was describing. One of the
boys followed with a recitation of Drake's
"American Flag." Next a small choir of
girls and boys (the girls dressed in the
national colors and the boys wearing flag
badges) sang the "Star Spangled Banner."
Then Winnie went upon the stage,
and recited the following, which is given
in full, as it is one of those fugitive things
which seem to have no home. It is entitled:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

      <div class="verse indent4">THE USED-TO-BE.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent0">The mother gathered her children together,</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">She folded them close to her heart in glee,</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">For the red sun had brought them rainy weather,</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">And what they should do, they never could see.</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">And they cried in querulous tones, "Mamma,</div>

      <div class="verse indent0">And see if <i>you</i> ever had rainy days</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">That troubled the plans, and spoiled the plays,</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">And what you did in the Used-to-be."</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent0">The mother laughed with low, soft laughter;</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">She was remembering, they could see.</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">"I see, you rogues, what you are all after;</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">I'll tell you a tale that happened to me.</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">I and some wee little bits of girls,</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">With hair as yellow as shaving-curls,</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">When it rained for a day and a night and a day,</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">And we thought it hard to go on that way,</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">As we were as tired as tired could be.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent0">"Up in the attic, in grandma's attic,</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">There's a chest of drawers&mdash;or there used to be;</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">Though we had many a charge emphatic,</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">Not to go near enough to see.</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">But one rainy day we opened them wide,</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">And strewed the contents on every side;</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">We dressed ourselves in the queer old caps,</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">The brass-buttoned coats, with long blue flaps.</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">And&mdash;but wait a minute; papa calls me."</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent0">They waited and waited and waited and waited,&mdash;</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">"Forty hours, it seems to me,"</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">Said weary Kitty, with eyes dilated.</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">"Let's do it ourselves; I can find the key."</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">They climbed the stairs,&mdash;as still as a mouse.</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">You might have heard them all over the house.</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">They dressed themselves in the queer old dresses,</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">The powdered wigs and hempen tresses,</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">Just as they did in the Used-to-be.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent0">The warning stairs kept creaking and creaking,&mdash;</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">There was no time to turn and flee.</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">"<i>What's all this!</i>" (It was grandma speaking.)</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">"I shall take every one of you over my knee."</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">And I regret to say that she did,</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">All except Kitty, who ran and hid.</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">And when they went and told mamma,</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">She only said, with a soft "ha! ha!"</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">"Just what your grandmamma did to me."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The amusing little poem suited Winnie's
childish face and figure, and her
mother had read between the lines for her,
so that the picture was plain to her mind.
Winnie saw the pretty young mother playing
the little joke on the children, and
the affected wrath of the grandmother as
she spanked each of the little ones&mdash;saw
the picture so plainly herself that it was
easy for her to make her good-natured
audience see it, too, and her hearers
laughed while they applauded.</p>

<p>Of course they had "The Red, White
and Blue" sung by the whole school;
and "America," which can never be old
to any of us; and for further recitations.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_26" title="26"> </a>
"Independence Bell," and "The Blue
and the Gray"&mdash;for what patriotic celebration
would be complete without these?</p>

<p>The finest declamation of the day,
given by the pride of the class, so far as
elocutionary ability was concerned, and
with a drum accompaniment by a corps of
boys well drilled for the occasion, was the
following stirring</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <p class="caption">Then Winnie recited.&mdash;See page 25.</p>
</div>

<p>But the crowning performance of the
day, in the opinion of all the girls and
boys, was a little drama, written expressly
for the occasion, entitled, "Revolutionary
Days." The characters
represented were
an elderly lady, two
young girls, two little
children, a negro servant
girl, an elderly
gentleman, a Tory,
and two young men,
Continental soldiers.</p>

<p>While the platform
was being cleared and
prepared, the girls and
boys who took part
were having what they
called "fine fun" in
the dressing-room,
getting their hair
powdered, caps and
wigs adjusted, and so
on.</p>

<p>When the curtain
rose, Miriam was discovered,
dressed as an
elderly lady of the
eighteenth century,
sitting in an old-fashioned
chair beside a
spinning-wheel, and
singing a song of Revolutionary days. As
she ceased singing, two little children, borrowed
from the primary class in the "Colony,"
came in, begging their grandmother
to tell them something about George
Washington. She tells them that she is
busy, but they persist, and then tell her
that they know some verses about him,
and each recites, alternately, a verse of
four lines, descriptive of Washington's
childhood and school days, and, as seems
inevitable, winding up with the story of
the hatchet.</p>

<p>As they finish, a negro servant girl
<a class="pagenum" name="page_28" title="28"> </a>
rushes in, in which burnt-cork heroine it
would be utterly impossible to discover the
maiden of the pickles and of the ardent
desire to enjoy herself while young, had
she not been seen in the dressing-room
"making up" for the occasion. She informs
Mrs. Grey that the cat or something
has pulled all the yarn off the reel, and
of its consequent fearful state of entanglement.
Mrs. Grey rouses herself from her
reverie, and asks the children if they know
anything about it. Each accusingly points
to the other, whereupon their grandmother
looks at them sternly, when they
say they "can't tell a lie," that they did
it with&mdash;</p>

<p>They are interrupted by Mrs. Grey, who
tells Dinah to take them away and put
them to bed without their supper. They
begin to howl, and reproachfully tell their
grandmother that she ought to say,
"Come to my arms, my precious children;"
whereupon an audacious small boy
in the audience&mdash;a visitor, it is needless
to say&mdash;shouts, "Chestnut!" and Mrs.
Grey's face hardens into a look of positive
inflexibility, as if this were the last straw,
and the children, howling and struggling,
are carried away by Dinah.</p>

<p>Quiet being thus restored, Mrs. Grey
paces up and down, indulging in a long
soliloquy. She speaks of the long years
of war, and the hope deferred which maketh
the heart sick. She regretfully recalls
the bonnie little island, with its
green fields and blooming gardens, which
had been forsaken for these scenes of
hardship. Then, however, she remembers
the days of oppression there, and bursts
into a thanksgiving that they had at last
found a spot where they could worship
God in peace according to the dictates of
their own conscience. Then she thinks
of the Declaration of Independence, and
tries to remember the resolution of Richard
Henry Lee. Seeing the girls come in,
she says that they will remember.</p>

<p>The two girls, Winnie and Fannie, attired
in short-waisted dresses, big poke
bonnets, and immense outside pockets, are
asked by Mrs. Grey to recall the resolution
which has for the moment slipped from
her recollection. One of them (Fannie),
in answer, declaims the resolution, and as
she comments, in rather excited tones,
"Glorious, mother, isn't it?" Mr. Cranston,
the Tory gentleman, enters. This
was one of the boys of the class, resplendent
in hempen wig, frilled shirt
front, and the veritable "brass-buttoned
coat, with long blue flaps," knee breeches,
and silver-buckled slippers. He tauntingly
informs them that they will find it
"too glorious, when the rebellion is
crushed, and they are all sentenced to be
executed as rebels."</p>

<p>Whereupon he and the colonial young
ladies enter into a heated argument, with
taunts on one side about the minute-men
of Massachusetts and the battles of Lexington
and Concord, and retaliations
from the Tory about the battle of Long
Island and the miseries at Valley Forge.
They retort with the news of the treaty
<a class="pagenum" name="page_29" title="29"> </a>
of alliance with France, and he replies by
reminding them of the loss of their ports
in the north.</p>

<p>He is interrupted by the entrance of
the children, who tell the group that
every one in the village is shouting
"Hurrah!" that the bell in the church
is ringing, and that the big flag is waving
over the roof. While the patriots are exclaiming
that "there must be good news,"
two young men enter, carrying guns. All
spring up in surprise, and the children
dance and caper about, with shouts of
"Uncle Mark! Uncle John!"</p>

<p>Mark and John inform Mrs. Grey and
their sisters of the surrender of Cornwallis.
The Tory makes his way out as
quietly as possible, with a very evident
desire to do so unobserved, saying, "Cornwallis
surrendered! Then this is no place
for me!" The curtain falls, as Mrs. Grey
exclaims, with clasped hands and upraised
eyes, "The morning has dawned at last!"</p>

<p>There was the usual applause, and soon
visitors and children&mdash;the entertained
and the entertainers&mdash;were on their
homeward way, and the "exhibition" had
become a part of the past.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>THE YOUNG WARRIOR MAIDS.</small></h2>


<p class="firstlargenoindent">
<span class="smcaps"><span class="firstlarge">A</span>fter</span>
the entertainment, things
went on in their accustomed
routine. Winnie, Miriam, Gretta and
Fannie became more intimate than ever,
and really tried, in spite of many discouragements,
to conquer their bad habits.</p>

<p>For a couple of weeks the little band
of "Giant Killers" had had no meetings,
but on the second week after the Washington
celebration, the four girls received a
pretty invitation from Winnifred's Aunt
Kitty to take tea with her on the following
Friday, and to consider themselves invited
to hold their next meeting at her home,
bidding them tell their mothers that the
hostess would see that they arrived home
safe not later than half-past nine. Also,
inclosed under cover to Winnie, was an
invitation for Ernestine Alroy, to be delivered
only in case the other three girls
were willing. Upon Winnie's showing
this, Fannie was the first to propose that
not only should the invitation be delivered,
but that Ernestine should be invited
to join their society.</p>

<p>The family of Winnie's grandmother
was a small one, Mrs. Benton often saying,
with a sigh, that her children had all left
her except Kitty and Fred. Whereupon
Kitty would take hold of her mother's
hand and assure her, in a serio-comic manner,
that this daughter she would have
ever beside her, "to warn, to comfort, to
command." Mrs. Benton was not
wealthy, but she had a comfortable income
of her own, and as Fred received a
very good salary in one of the large railroad
offices, they always had means for the
comforts of life and many of its luxuries.
They lived in a suite of rooms in one of
the finest apartment houses of the city.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_30" title="30"> </a>
The "Arlington" was a very large
building, and as the girls were not accustomed
to such immense houses, they had
arranged with Winnie that they should all
go together at five o'clock. Accordingly
that hour found them all standing in the
vestibule together, to the manifest amusement
of the janitor when he answered
Winnie's ring. As Mrs. Benton's apartment
was only one flight up, they did not
take the elevator, but Winnie ran lightly
up the stairs, the others following more
slowly. She knocked at the door at the
right of the hall, which was immediately
opened by Miss Benton, to whom Winnie
introduced the other girls, who more or
less timidly put their hands into the outstretched
one of this pleasant young lady,
but found their timidity vanish almost as
if by magic when they felt her warm,
cordial clasp as she drew them into the
parlor.</p>

<p>And a very pretty parlor it was, with a
quaint individuality of its own&mdash;"just
like Kitty Benton herself," as her friends
were wont to say. There were no two
chairs alike, but they all agreed in one respect&mdash;that
of being exceedingly comfortable,
from the high-backed willow to
the low chair upholstered in old gold and
scarlet tapestry.</p>

<p>On the walls were five or six oil paintings&mdash;a
couple of marines, and the others
bright, summer landscapes. There was
one, which Miss Benton had herself
painted, entirely different from the others.
A cloudy sky, with dim, gray mountains in
the distance. In the foreground a single
grave under a willow, but lying in such
vivid sunlight, which came from a break
in the clouds, that it had almost a jubilant
look for so sad a subject, as most people
would have deemed it. On a low shelf
stood a beautifully engraved Madonna,
and on a table near was a portfolio of fine
etchings. About the room were bits of
bric-a-brac of various kinds, among them
a piece of genuine old Wedgwood. On the
upright piano stood a tall vase of Easter
lilies.</p>

<p>Miss Benton, having helped her young
visitors to divest themselves of their
wraps, seated them close to the open fire,
and then took down the etchings to show
them. These, however, proved a little beyond
them, so she took from the table a
stereoscope and some views, every one of
which had been collected by her mother or
herself during their various trips, and
about each one she told some incident,
amusing or pathetic, so that an hour had
passed away almost before the girls knew
it.</p>

<p>Fred had been requested by his sister to
take his supper downtown, as she felt that
the girls would feel more at their ease
without his presence. When the bright-faced
maid announced supper, Miss Benton
took Gretta by the hand, and said, as
they all entered the dining-room, "'We
are seven,' and, I presume, if Wordsworth
were here, he would write a poem about
us."</p>

<p>As the five friends took their places,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_31" title="31"> </a>
they simultaneously burst into an exclamation
of delight. At each of their
places was a bunch of flowers, with a card
on which was a pretty little painting in
water-colors of a young girl, with fair hair
streaming over her shoulders, in full
armor, receiving from an angel a sword.
Underneath were the words in old English
text, in scarlet and gold, "He that overcometh
shall inherit all things."</p>

<p>The cards were exactly alike, but the
flowers were different. Miriam had a
glorious red rose, with buds and leaves;
Gretta, garden daisies and primroses; Fannie,
scarlet geraniums, a calla lily and a
wild jack-in-the-pulpit; Ernestine, lilies
of the valley; Winnie, ferns and mignonette.
Mrs. Benton lifted caressingly to
her face a bunch of English violets, and
their hostess pinned on her bodice a cluster
of yellow rosebuds.</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt Kitty, what a hunt you
must have had among the florists and
markets for all these flowers!" said Winnie.</p>

<p>"And how well you have suited us all!"
cried Miriam.</p>

<p>"What is this, Miss Benton?" asked
Fannie, holding up the jack-in-the-pulpit.</p>

<p>"That is a wild-flower," replied Miss
Benton, giving the blossom its name,
"which was sent me from Tennessee this
week; it does not bloom quite so early
here. If you will examine it and compare
it with your calla, you will see many
points of resemblance; indeed, they are of
the same family, although the splendid
Egyptian calla has all the advantages of
climate, water and sun, which make it the
handsome thing it is. But our little
American Jack, all the same, lifts its head
out of its green pulpit and preaches to us
of the eternal kinship of all things. Put
your geraniums in your button hole, and
after tea I'll put your calla and its country
cousin in water for you to keep fresh
till you go home."</p>

<p>"How did you know I was fond of
lilies of the valley, Miss Benton?" asked
Ernestine. "It is my mother's favorite
flower, too; she says they used to grow in
great clumps in the yard of her home
when she was a girl, and she never sees one
without thinking of her childhood."</p>

<p>"Of course I couldn't know that, my
dear; I only thought that you would like
them. Although I had never met any of
you I have heard Winnifred talk about
you, and her little tongue sometimes gives
me queer ideas," said Miss Benton, smiling
at her niece with an air of good comradeship.</p>

<p>"Mother, let Winnie serve the chocolate,
while I attend to this end of the
table. You see, girls, we only have the
maid bring in the dishes from the kitchen,
for we like to wait on each other," she
said, helping them to chicken croquettes,
cold ham, and delicious muffins, as Winnie
passed around the chocolate in dainty
china cups.</p>

<p>How they all enjoyed that supper!
They were just like girls in a book, Miriam
said. Everything seemed so different
<a class="pagenum" name="page_32" title="32"> </a>
from ordinary occasions. Even the orange
jelly tasted so much better than at other
times, because of the orange baskets in
which it was served. They sat at the table
a long time, for both Mrs. Benton and her
daughter encouraged their visitors to talk;
and while they were eating their candy
and nuts, they played the game of rhymes
and "yes and no."</p>

<p>Then Miss Kitty sent them into the
parlor with her mother, excusing herself
and Winnie for a few moments. When
they entered the parlor, they found Mrs.
Benton with her silk socks in her hands,
knitting as rapidly as she was talking.
She was giving them an account of the
old turkey gobbler that used to chase her
when she was a little girl, and they were
all laughing heartily.</p>

<p>This anecdote led to Miriam's giving an
account of a goat which one of her aunt's
friends had presented to her little boy,
and which was the terror of the neighborhood.</p>

<p>"My aunt and I," said Miriam, "were
making an afternoon visit at Mrs. Kincaid's,
and, as it was warm and pleasant,
we were invited into the yard to look at
the flowers. My aunt was very enthusiastically
admiring a fine Yucca which, for
a wonder, was in bloom, when the goat
was seen peering through a gap in the
fence which divided the front from the
back yard.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Kincaid immediately took to her
heels, and I was about to follow, when
Aunt Jennie said, 'Miriam, I am surprised
that you should be afraid of a goat.
Even if he were to come near you, you
would only have to seize him by the horns;
it is the easiest thing in the world to
conquer a goat.'</p>

<p>"By this time Mrs. Kincaid was safe in
the house, tapping loudly on the window,
from which she was viewing the scene,
for us to come in, and 'dancing crazy' (as
the girls say about things), because we
were still outside.</p>

<p>"My aunt was walking in a leisurely
and dignified manner toward the house,
holding her head a little higher than
usual, and I was following very meekly for
me&mdash;for I hate to be thought a coward&mdash;when
the goat gave a sudden bound,
broke another picket in the fence, and
went straight toward her with his head
down, and his bob tail switching.</p>

<p>"Well, Aunt Jennie did turn and face
him, and she really did take the vicious
little beast by the horns. But was he
conquered? You wouldn't have thought
so, had you been there; he just raised himself
on his hind legs and shook himself
loose. Aunt Jennie suddenly dropped her
dignity, and flew, rather than ran, toward
the house, the goat after her, and she just
escaped him by Mrs. Kincaid's pulling
her inside the door and slamming it shut.</p>

<p>"As for me, I went through the hole in
the fence to the back yard, rushed pell-mell
into the kitchen door, without stopping
to knock, and dropped into the
nearest chair, where I sat and laughed till
the tears ran down my cheeks, to the astonishment
<a class="pagenum" name="page_33" title="33"> </a>
of the kitchen girl and the
washerwoman, who were enjoying a cup
of tea.</p>

<p>"I was wicked enough to laugh afterward,
for Aunt Jennie did not lecture on
courage or dignity for a month after that,
and I notice now that when we pass a
livery stable she keeps a quiet but effective
lookout for 'the horned monarch of the
livery stable,' as I once heard him called."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm afraid of goats myself," said
Miss Kitty, "and I think there ought to
be a law against their being allowed inside
the city limits. What with the small boy
who torments the goat, and the goat
which cannot distinguish between his tormentor
and any other member of the human
race, every passer-by is certain of being
made ridiculous, if nothing more
serious occurs. But to change the subject,
would you young giant-killers like
to hear a story that I have written for
you?"</p>

<p>Of course they were delighted, and, the
softly-shaded lamp having been adjusted,
and Mrs. Benton seated so that the light
fell upon her knitting, Miss Benton took
her seat at the other side of the table, and
read the following allegory:</p>


<p class="center margtop2">GIANT PROCRASTINATION.</p>

<p>Stretching off far as the eye can reach,
lies a vast plain, intersected by many roads
of various widths, from the narrowest
foot-path to those wide enough for three
or four vehicles to pass abreast. Pleasant
roads they seem to be, too; wild-flowers of
brilliant hues grow along their sides, birds
of beautiful plumage twitter their varied
notes, and pretty little squirrels and rabbits
dart here and there. But when the
saunterer along one of these by-paths
plucks the blossoms, they fall to pieces in
his hands, and, on near approach, the
birds circle for a few moments about the
head, and then fly away and are seen no
more.</p>

<p>These by-ways continually lead into and
cross one another, but all at last meet in
one broad road, and this is the road of
"By and By," which leads to the castle of
"Never." This castle stands at the entrance
to a dark and gloomy forest,
through which no path has ever been cut,
and which is so dense and wild that one
draws back in fear, finding it impossible
not to think of it as inhabited by
beasts and serpents and insects as wild
and poisonous as those which infest the
South American forests or the jungles of
India.</p>

<p>At the right and left of the castle rise
huge cliffs unscaled by mortal foot during
the lifetime of the present owner, and
seldom attempted even during the ages
gone by, when his ancestors, in a more or
less direct line, held high orgies, while
with demoniac laughter they tortured
their victims.</p>

<p>The present owner and occupant of the
castle is a giant, so skilled in the art of
metamorphosis that he is constantly deceiving
and deluding his victims, each of
whom he approaches in a different manner.
With some he wears an air of
<a class="pagenum" name="page_34" title="34"> </a>
haughty though courteous dignity, and
gives them fair and sweet promises of
granting their every desire as soon as his
plans are perfected and he is ready. With
others, he puts on a smiling, joyous look,
points out to them the birds and flowers
along the roadside, and tells them that
to-morrow all these pleasures shall be
theirs. A different face and garb for
every deluded follower, who ever ends in
becoming his victim; for, just at the entrance
to the castle, still covered by the
seemingly fair flowers, is a frightful
morass, out of which the wanderer is
helped only by the giant himself, and
taken by him thence into the castle, from
which there is no escape.</p>

<p>The dreadful Castle of Never! And
yet, how fair it looks to those who stand
just outside its gates! Its battlemented
towers, decorated with flags and banners
floating gayly in the air, its many windows,
catching and reflecting every ray
of sunlight, its majestic proportions, make
it seem a dwelling much to be desired.
And either because it is enchanted, or
from some strange property of the surrounding
atmosphere, it often appears to
be raised high in the air, so that at a very
great distance it shows larger, if less distinct,
than when viewed near by.</p>

<p>It is early morning. The sun himself
has not yet risen, although his approach
is heralded by lovely green and rose tints
on the eastern horizon. The great Giant
Procrastination lies stretched upon his
huge bed, dreaming uneasily, for he
groans and starts many times, but still
sleeps on. The inside of the far-famed
castle shows not so fair as the outside.
There are many things lying about on
tables and chairs, or tucked away under
articles of larger furniture; some of them
are pretty, some elegant, but all unfinished.</p>

<p>The morning wind, rising as if it, too,
had lain asleep during the night, shrieks
and whistles as if in wrath, or moans and
sighs as though in mortal anguish. And
hush! What other sound is that which
rises above the roar of the wind and fills
one's soul with terror? Alas! it is the
shrieks of despair from the prisoners in
the dungeon, and one hears, mingled with
their groans, the dreadful words, "Too
late! Too late!"</p>

<p>But who are these descending the heretofore
unscaled cliff? And how comes it
that thus unguided they have escaped the
dangers of the forest, and that, now stealing
upon their sleeping foe from the unguarded
rear, they are not dashed into
pieces as they make the steep and terrible
descent? Ah! they have an invisible
Guide, who goes before and smooths every
difficulty; and their feet are shod with a
divine determination which leads them securely
over the most dangerous places.</p>

<p>And yet they move with caution.
Clinging now to the bushes that grow
along the cliff, now stepping carefully on
some jutting crag, they come one by one.
Now they have reached the bottom, and
stop a moment to take breath and consult
<a class="pagenum" name="page_35" title="35"> </a>
as to the next movement. For behold!
five little maidens, scarcely in their teens,
have come to give battle to one of the
strongest enemies of mankind, and to attack
him in his own stronghold. Brave as
they are, however, and resolutely as they
have nerved themselves to the task ahead
of them, they cannot repress a shudder as
they gaze upon the frowning mass
before them. For, never dreaming of attack
in the rear, the giant's ancestors had
taken no pains to make that part of the
castle beautiful or to endow it with the
enchantment of illusion, so all is dark and
strong and terrible.</p>

<p>Regaining courage, the five young warriors
kneel upon the rocky path and ask
their invisible Guide for succor and
strength. They rise encouraged and
hopeful, and each assists the other to readjust
her armor. Wonderful armor!
light to wear, but stronger than mailed
steel.</p>

<p>They advance to the heavy door. It is
all unguarded, and even stands partly
open, so that all their strength is saved
to them for the combat. One by one, and
noiselessly, they climb the iron stairs, and,
guided by his snores, they find themselves
at last in the presence of their sleeping
enemy.</p>

<p>If they can but strike now! One blow
from either of their swords, and he would
lie slain before them. But alas! they hesitate
for one short moment, and in that
brief space of time the wind bangs a heavy
shutter against the iron casement, and, at
its fearful clang, the giant awakes and
rises to his feet. He stares about him for
a moment, stupefied, but there is no mistaking
the fact that he is in the presence
of an enemy; for their armor, their uplifted
swords, their resolute mien, all proclaim
their errand to be one of war. Then,
gazing upon their diminutive forms, he
laughs a horrid, blood-curdling laugh, as
he gloats over the prospect that he will
soon have five more victims to languish
in his dungeons.</p>

<p>He springs forward to seize the foremost
of his youthful foes, but her fear has
vanished. Raising her shield for protection,
she strikes with her sword, and the
giant receives a fearful gash in the hand
outstretched to grasp her, and starts back,
howling with pain. The five girls close
around him at once, but so immense of
stature is he, that they soon perceive it
will be impossible for them to reach a
vital part unless he can be thrown.</p>

<p>Fast and furious they rain the blows
upon him, and not in vain. He has no
armor on, his usual weapons are beyond
his reach, and he knows instinctively that
his usual powers of metamorphosis are
useless. One blow, at last, inflicts a
ghastly wound in his ankle; he clutches
at the bed for support, but misses it, and
falls, groaning heavily, at full length on
the floor, where, taken at a disadvantage,
a sword is thrust into his heart, and with
horrid struggles he dies.</p>

<p>The maiden warriors embrace each
other joyfully, and, kneeling together in
<a class="pagenum" name="page_36" title="36"> </a>
that moment of victory, give all the praise
and glory to that invisible Power which
has enabled them, weak girls as they are,
to conquer.</p>

<p>But their work is not yet done. Taking
the keys from under the pillow of the
dead monster, they pass down a winding
staircase, until they find themselves so far
beneath the surface of the earth, that not
a ray of light shines over their pathway.</p>

<p>One of them lights a tiny lamp which
she has brought with her, and they
proceed. At length they reach the
foot of the stairs and find themselves
in a dark, narrow passage, with many
windings and turnings. Along this they
proceed carefully, until they stand before
the massive doors of the dungeon. Trying
one key after another, they find one
that turns the lock, and the door swings
open. What a sight meets their sorrowful
gaze! Bones&mdash;human bones&mdash;lie
scattered everywhere, and, as they become
more accustomed to the darkness, they distinguish
human forms still living, with
haggard faces, and despair written on
every feature.</p>

<p>"Your enemy is dead!" say the maidens.
"We have come to set you free, and
then we are going to burn the castle, for
thus has our Guide commanded us."</p>

<p>As they all stand once more in the
glad sunlight, they set fire to the mighty
structure, and see the leaping, victorious
flames devour it, even to the flags and
banners which had so short a time before
streamed gayly from its towers.</p>


<p class="margtop2">"Thank you, Aunt Kitty," said Winnifred,
as Miss Benton laid down the
manuscript. "I don't see how you ever
thought of all that."</p>

<p>"Well, Winnie, we all know that the
idea is taken from the book you have recently
been reading, but where no pretense
is made to originality, imitation is
not deception."</p>

<p>"But do you really think, Miss Benton,"
said Ernestine, raising her eyes,
"that we can so completely conquer our
faults?"</p>

<p>"Alas, no! I'm afraid we never can
completely conquer them, but by striving
constantly we can strike many a blow,
each one of which leaves the enemy
weaker, and ourselves stronger. The
great pity of it all is, that we can kill only
our own giants, and destroy their strongholds
for ourselves; we can never do it for
others, dearly as we may love them."</p>

<p>"Well," said Fannie, in her decided
manner, "I wish that Procrastination
were the only giant to fight; but I have
some enemies which are still harder for
me to conquer;" and she blushed slightly,
as she involuntarily glanced toward
Ernestine.</p>

<p>"It is a great gain, however," said Mrs.
Benton, pausing in her knitting, "when
we have learned to do that which must be
done, without unnecessary delay. Procrastination,
it is quite true, is the least
vicious and the least malicious of all the
faults; but stronger, almost, than any
other, and holding more people, young
<a class="pagenum" name="page_37" title="37"> </a>
and old, under its control. If this be
overcome, the struggle with the others
grows easier. Indeed, it is surprising
how many little misdeeds are the outcome
of that one fault. Untidiness, fits of temper,
disobedience, prevarication, and sometimes
even downright untruth, might
often be avoided if things were done in
time."</p>

<p>"But it is hard always to remember,"
sighed Miriam. "Ernestine, how do you
keep from forgetting?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I forget oftener than you know,"
said Ernestine, flushing under her delicate
skin; "but I have had mamma to think
of, and have tried to please her and make
her happy; then, too, I had a nurse in
Louisiana who taught me to remember
that there is One 'who is a very present
help in time of trouble.'"</p>

<p>"That is the best help of all, girls, and
one that you can carry with you always.
I find mottoes and texts a great help, too,
when I want to succeed in any one particular
thing. How would it do, at your
next meeting, for each one to contribute
a text from the Bible, and, if possible, a
quotation from one of the poets, applicable
to this same wheedling fault?" said
Miss Benton.</p>

<p>"I should like that very much," replied
Ernestine.</p>

<p>"So would I!" "And I!" "And I!"
replied Miriam, Fannie and Winnie.</p>

<p>Gretta only was silent, but Miss Kitty
judged it best to pass her silence by without
remark.</p>

<p>At this moment, Mr. Fred Benton entered
the parlor and was introduced to the
girls, and very soon they were all escorted
to their homes by their friend's uncle, who
proved himself as good an entertainer of
these little women as was his sister.</p>

ever so humble,
there's no place like
home," carolled Winnie,
as she descended
the stairs the next
morning, feeling happy
and contented, and as
if the world were a pleasant place in
which to live and love and to succeed in
being good. She felt at peace with everybody,
and had such a sense of security
that she imagined her giants all conquered,
and saw in rosy hues a future of
beautiful and pleasant right-doing.</p>

<p>What was her surprise when she entered
the dining-room, expecting to find
the usual tempting breakfast on the table,
to see not the slightest signs of it, and to
find the room unoccupied except by little
Ralph, who was sitting in front of the
empty grate in his night-clothes; and a
very cross little boy Winnie soon found
him to be, for he set up a howl the moment
he saw her.</p>

<p>"'Innie, I 'ants to be d'essed, and it's
ugly izout any fire, and I 'ants my b'eakast."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_38" title="38"> </a>
"Whatever is the matter?" said Winnie.
But she received no answer except
the whining refrain, "I 'ants my b'eakast,"
until she began to feel so irritated
that she would have liked to shake the
child.</p>

<p>This, however, she did not do, simply
because she did not dare. But instead of
attempting to soothe him, she went into
the kitchen to find out from Norah the
reason for this unusual state of affairs.
Instead of Norah, she found her mother
heating water and making mustard plasters,
with an anxious look on her face.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, mamma?" asked
Winnie; "and where are papa and Jack?"</p>

<p>"They had important business at the
store and couldn't wait, but will take
breakfast downtown. Norah was taken
very sick in the night, but she said nothing
about it, and came down as usual this
morning to get breakfast, and I found her
in a dead faint on the kitchen floor.
Your father and I got her upstairs between
us, and Jack went for the doctor.
He says it is nothing serious, but that
Norah will have to keep still for two or
three days. Help me carry these things
to Norah's room, and then you will have
to come downstairs and get some breakfast
for us."</p>

<p>Winnie took the pail of water which her
mother handed to her, and started upstairs,
feeling a strange sense of resentment
against Norah, as if she were to
blame for this unpleasant condition of
affairs.</p>

<p>When they reached Norah's room, her
mother said, "Put down the pail, Winnie,
and make haste downstairs and see if
you can't get things into some kind of
order; it's getting very late."</p>

<p>Winnie put the water down so hurriedly
that it splashed over the floor. Then she
went out, but instead of hurrying, went
down clinging to the balusters as if she
could not and would not make any exertion.</p>

<p>When she opened the dining-room door
Ralph said: "I sink Norah's mean to det
sick; she dust did it a-purpose, so Ralph
touldn't have any b'eakast."</p>

<p>"Why, Ralph," said Winnie, "you
ought to be ashamed of yourself! Of
course it's no fun for Norah to be sick."
But as she spoke to Ralph, her conscience
reproached her, for she knew in her heart
that she had had the same feeling, if not
the same thought. This startled her, as if
she had suddenly had a mirror held up before
her mind, and she spoke to the little
boy more pleasantly, telling him to come
into the kitchen with her and watch her
make the coffee and cook some ham and
eggs for breakfast.</p>

<p>But although aware that her conscience
was speaking to her, Winnie had not in
the least succeeded in overcoming her irritable
feelings. She had made plans for
such a pleasant day! She had intended to
practice faithfully, and get through all
her little duties early in the afternoon, so
that she could take Ralph through market&mdash;something
that she particularly
<a class="pagenum" name="page_39" title="39"> </a>
liked to do; it was always so exciting to
her to see the people jostling each other,
to hear them haggling over the price of
something, to see the strange types and
characters, and to imagine the different
motives which brought these different
people together. Besides, she had been
saving her money to surprise her mother
with a pot of English violets from the
flower market, which would be sure to be
particularly lovely this afternoon, for the
sun shone out brightly, giving promise of
an unusually warm day for March.</p>

<p>"How could people do their duty, if
they never knew what it was going to
be?" she mused, as she measured out the
coffee and put it into the filter. But as
she went to turn the water over it, she remembered
that her mother had emptied
the hot water from the kettle into the
pail.</p>

<p>"I should think mamma might have
taken the water out of the tank for
Norah!" she said, half aloud, although
she knew very well that the water in the
tank was scarcely warm, as she proceeded
to fill the kettle.</p>

<p>She poked the fire viciously, feeling as
if here she could give her impatience some
vent.</p>

<p>The ham, fortunately, Norah had sliced
the evening before, otherwise in her present
state of irritation Winnie would certainly
have cut her fingers.</p>

<p>Now, when Winnie chose, she could be
a very nice little housekeeper; but this
morning, as may well be imagined, everything
went wrong, as she said, never
thinking that perhaps her own impatience
might be at fault. She burnt the ham,
the eggs did not break open nicely, she
cut her finger in slicing the bread, and altogether
it took her so long to get breakfast
that poor little Ralph, still running
about in his night-clothes, was, as he expressed
it, "starved 'mos' to death."</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton came down before Winnie
had finished setting the table, and a
glance at the little girl's flushed face was
sufficient to tell the observant mother the
true state of affairs. As usual in such
cases, however, she said nothing, but
called Ralph and took him upstairs to be
dressed, telling Winnie that she would be
down in ten minutes for breakfast.</p>

<p>When they came down, Mrs. Burton
said:</p>

<p>"This morning we will not say our
verses till after breakfast, as I am sure
we are all of us too hungry to receive any
benefit from them now;" and she proceeded
to pour the coffee. Then Winnie
saw that she had forgotten the cream and
jumped up to get it.</p>

<p>"Your coffee is very nice, Winnie,"
said her mother.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, I didn't think anything
would be nice! I had such a time! The
fire wouldn't burn, and I burnt my fingers
and afterward cut them, and everything
was horrid generally."</p>

<p>"I had a defful time gene'lly, too,"
said Ralph. "I was so hung'y I toudn't
wait, and 'Innie 'ouldn't div me a
<a class="pagenum" name="page_40" title="40"> </a>
tracker, and said I'se a bodder. Is I a
bodder, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Not when you're a good boy, my pet.
Sister doesn't always think so, either; but
you see, this morning she had so much
to do."</p>

<p>"Did Norah det sick so 'Innie have to
'ork so hard? Poor 'Innie!" And the
little fellow stroked Winnie's hand, while
she scarcely knew whether to laugh or
cry.</p>

<p>Altogether it was quite an unusual
breakfast. Ralph ate three eggs, and
more bread and butter than he had ever
been known to eat before; and Winnie felt
her own impatience dying away to some
extent, as her hunger diminished, although
she had not realized before that
she was hungry.</p>

<p>After breakfast Mrs. Burton gave her
text, and then called upon Winnie for
hers. Up to that moment Winnie's text
had entirely left her mind, and she recited
it with a feeling of shame as she remembered
the contrast between her morning
conduct and the somewhat puffed-up
feeling with which she had selected it:
"He that ruleth his own spirit is greater
than he that taketh a city."</p>

<p>"Perhaps only the One above knows
how hard it is for people to govern their
own spirits. The temptation to yield to
self is so strong that it sometimes seems
as if there is nothing that will conquer it,"
commented Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>"But mamma, everybody says, 'Do the
duty that lies nearest thee.' How are we
to do this, when we never know what
is going to happen from one day to another?
This morning I thought I was
going to get my music lesson, and now
how can I do that?"</p>

<p>"That is where we all make mistakes,
Winnifred. We lay our plans, and are
annoyed and vexed when something occurs
to change them. We are like soldiers
placed on the field of battle. Some
of us would like an easy place; some
would rather stay behind and guard the
rear; others, in spite of danger, wish to
press forward where 'glory waits them.'
But we cannot choose either our own
places or the attending circumstances.
All we can do is to fall to 'with might
and main.' God will take care of the ordinary
duties, but there are some things
which brook no delay. Do we not know
how the Savior turned away from the
chosen way to heal the sick or comfort the
afflicted? But I think that my present
duty is to cut my sermon short, for both
you and I will have a great deal to do
to-day. I will attend to things upstairs,
and will be down to do the baking by the
time you are through the work here."</p>

<p>So saying, Mrs. Burton rose from the
table and left the room. Winnie still felt
a sense of disappointment, but the little
sermon, arising, as it did, from the text
she herself had selected, had been good
for her, and she went to work cheerfully
and systematically, and the difficulties
which an hour ago had seemed so great,
all disappeared.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_41" title="41"> </a>
Ralph, too&mdash;who was so unlike most
children of his age as not to be fond of
doing anything that appeared in the least
like work&mdash;seemed animated by the
spirit of the occasion, and trotted back
and forth between the kitchen and dining-room
carrying a plate or a cup and
saucer, and feeling that he was helping
greatly.</p>

<p>As for Winnie, she had none of the feeling
of some girls who are ashamed to be
seen doing housework, for her mother
had taught her, both by word and example,
the folly and sinfulness of such a
notion, and that it is the worker who
degrades the work instead of the opposite;
and as a very little girl, Winnie had
learned Herbert's fine lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Who sweeps a room as by God's laws,</div>
      <div class="verse">Makes that and the action fine."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now that she was working cheerfully,
she even found a pleasure in dish-washing,
as who should not, given plenty of
hot water, clean towels, a pleasant kitchen
with the sun shining in, and a little
cherub of a brother chattering on with his
cunning tongue, which finds so much
difficulty in pronouncing the consonants?</p>

<p>So, when Mrs. Burton returned to the
kitchen, everything was in fine order, and
a bright fire had prepared the oven to do
its share in the Saturday baking.</p>

<p>When noon came, Winnie really felt
that she had had a pleasant morning, although
it had been spent in beating eggs
and grating lemons; besides, she had for
once had her mother all to herself, and
she sat down to the lunch she had prepared
feeling quite happy.</p>

<p>She did not get an opportunity to leave
the house all that day, except to do two
or three errands in the neighborhood.
She took Norah's toast and tea up to
her, and spent the greater part of the
afternoon in her room, trying to make
amends for the morning's impatience by
bathing the sick girl's head, changing her
pillows, and moistening her parched lips.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>RALPH'S BIRTHDAY.</small></h2>


<div class="floatl">
  <img class="plain" src="images/i41.jpg" width="156" height="227" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap16">
<span class="smcaps"><span class="invisible">A </span>few</span>
days after the
events narrated in the
last chapter, a bright,
sunshiny morning
ushered in Ralph's
fourth birthday anniversary,
and a fine
time he had receiving,
in the first place,
four little love taps and then four kisses
from each member of the family in turn.</p>

<p>Norah had entirely recovered from her
illness, and had baked a cake especially
for him, lighted by four wax candles,
which was placed in front of Ralph's plate
at breakfast time. His father gave him
that toy most delightful to the average
boy&mdash;a mechanical engine. Jack's gift
was a basket of fruit, his mother's a humming
top, and Winnie's a little autograph
album, in which she had copied the following
verse, written by Aunt Kitty:<a class="pagenum" name="page_42" title="42"> </a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent0">"Many tiny sunbeams fill the world with light,</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">Tiny drops of water make the ocean's might;</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">Tiny bits of goodness, that tiny laddies do,</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">Fill our homes with gladness and make our hearts glad, too."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Ralph was much pleased at having a little
book all his own, with a verse in it
made on purpose for him, and he had
Winnie read it over and over, until presently
he could say it himself.</p>

<p>But the crowning gift of all was sent
to the house just as they were at dinner,
labeled "From Grandma, Aunt Kitty and
Uncle Fred." It was a handsome velocipede,
just the right height to fit the little
short legs. Strange to say, Ralph learned
to manage it at once and rode right off on
it, and when Aunt Kitty came to take
him and Winnie to the park, it was with
great difficulty that he could be prevailed
upon to leave it behind. Finally they effected
a compromise by allowing him to
take his humming top, which he insisted
on stopping to spin every few rods, much
to the amusement of Aunt Kitty and the
intense though unexpressed disgust and
mortification of Winnie.</p>

<p>When they reached the park they sat
down on one of the benches to rest awhile,
and watched Ralph feed the swans with
some crumbs from the cake which he had
brought. After that Aunt Kitty took
them to the pretty dock, and, having selected
a boat, rowed them around the
lake, to the great interest of some boys,
who called out to each other, "Come and
see a girl row a boat!"</p>

<p>Suddenly Ralph gave one of his tremendous
howls, and Winnie grasped him
just in time to keep him from pitching
headlong into the water. He had dropped
his top in the lake, and was trying in vain
to seize it before it sank.</p>

<p>It was some time before he could be
pacified, and it was not till his aunt had
him sit beside her and take hold of one
oar and help her row, that he could be
comforted. The remainder of the boat
ride was very pleasant, and they supposed
the child had forgotten all about the loss
of his top. When they went home to supper,
however, and Mr. Burton asked:
"Well, my little man, what have you
done with your birthday?"</p>

<p>"I took it to the park and lost it in the
lake, papa!" was the unexpected reply.</p>

<p>"Fortunate child!" exclaimed Aunt
Kitty, catching Ralph up, and laughing.
"How happy the rest of us would be if we
could dispose of our yearly reminders of
the lapse of time in the same way! We
might fancy ourselves blessed with the
gift of eternal youth if it were not for our
birthdays."</p>

<p>But Ralph was not yet through celebrating.
It was very seldom that Mrs. Burton
allowed him to go out in the evening,
but this was a special occasion, and
as there was an opportunity for him to
have a treat, she thought it only right for
them to take advantage of it. There was
to be a stereopticon entertainment at their
Sunday-school, and they were all going.
Ralph had not been told until supper was
over, and even then, short as the time was
<a class="pagenum" name="page_43" title="43"> </a>
until they should start out, he could
hardly restrain his impatience.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="images/i43.jpg" width="693" height="530" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">They watched Ralph feed the swans.&mdash;See page 42.</p>
</div>

<p>Aunt Kitty took him on her lap and
told him the story of Red Riding-Hood
and the Fair One with the Golden Locks,
and repeated "Mother Goose" jingles to
him, and thus managed to keep him
somewhat contented until time to start.</p>

<p>The walk through the lighted streets
was a great pleasure to the little fellow.
They went down Central Avenue, and, all
the stores being lighted, it seemed to the
child a different and mysterious world,
more full of lights and people than the
one he had been accustomed to.</p>

<p>"Now, Ralph," said his father, "we
are going to see a great many beautiful
things to-night. But this is different
from most times; for generally, the more
light we have, the better we can see; but
these pictures can be seen better in the
dark, and they put out all the lights.
When that happens, some foolish boy or
girl may cry, but I want my little man to
keep hold of papa's hand and not say one
word till he sees the beautiful pictures."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_44" title="44"> </a>
"I doesn't twy, papa!" said Ralph, indignantly.
"I'se a big boy now&mdash;not a
dreat big boy, but a little big boy. And
I hasn't twied&mdash;oh, not for twenty-ten
days, I dess."</p>

<p>"Very well," said papa, "be sure to
remember that by and by."</p>

<p>When they reached the church it was
still quite early, and the few people already
there were laughing and chatting
and having a pleasant time. This was
very much to Ralph's disapproval. He
did not attend church often, but when he
did go, he had been talked to so much
about keeping still, particularly by Winnie,
that he thought it very naughty to
make a noise in church, so now he said
in a loud whisper:</p>

<p>"Papa, I sink dose people is very
naughty, to talk out loud in church."</p>

<p>"But this isn't Sunday, Ralph," his
father said; "you may talk, too, if you
like."</p>

<p>Ralph was so surprised at this that he
had nothing to say for some time.</p>

<p>Presently some of the girls of Winnie's
Sunday-school class came and she went
away with them, and Miss Benton
stepped across the aisle to speak to some
friends. This secession grieved Ralph
very much. "I sink auntie's weal mean,
to go and stay wiz dose ozzer people!" he
said.</p>

<p>"Aunt Kitty will come back in a few
moments, Ralph," said mamma.</p>

<p>By and by all the people stopped talking
and took their seats, and Aunt Kitty
came back and sat down beside Ralph.
Two men entered and placed a big screen
in the front part of the church. The
organist began to play something slow
and sweet and solemn, which made one
think of things sad but not unhappy.</p>

<p>The lights were suddenly turned out,
and Ralph had just time to draw his
breath quickly, and seize his father's
hand and snuggle up close to him, when a
picture appeared on the screen, and his
father lifted him up that he might see it
better.</p>

<p>On the screen they saw a lonely, desolate
mountain, which two persons were
slowly ascending, one of them bearing an
armful of wood. One represented an old
man; the other was a young, slender boy.
The organ was now giving forth minor
strains, in queer, broken time, full of
heartache.</p>

<p>The next picture showed Abraham
binding Isaac on the altar, and the look of
surprise and terror on the face of the boy
was equalled only by the intense but submissive
expression of sorrow on the face
of the old man.</p>

<p>The organ was still sounding its sad
tones, when the picture changed again,
and this time the angel was staying Abraham's
hand. And now the organ pealed
forth tones of joy and gladness.</p>

<p>The next views thrown on the screen
appeared to be scenes in Switzerland.
These Ralph did not seem to be at all interested
in, until they saw a representation
of Lake Lucerne, showing some children
<a class="pagenum" name="page_45" title="45"> </a>
rowing a boat. This reminded Ralph of
the loss of his humming-top, and he said,
quite loudly, "Do you sink, papa, that
little boy lost his birfday, too?"</p>

<p>"If he did," said Aunt Kitty, "he will
probably find another one to make up for
its loss."</p>

<p>The next picture was that of Jacob's
Dream; a tall ladder, reaching to the sky,
with the bright-winged "angels ascending
and descending on it," as the narrative so
simply tells us. Jacob lay with his head
on its stony pillow, a wondering but
happy look on his face, and his arms outstretched
as if he would fain seize the
lovely vision.</p>

<p>The dreamy tones of Schumann's
"Traumerie" stole upon the air, and
changed from that, with skillful modulations,
into a grand anthem, and the big
chorus choir, which till now had been silent,
burst into joyful but majestic
strains: "The Lord reigneth; let the people
tremble."</p>

<p>Ralph knew this picture quite well.
He had seen it many times in the big
family Bible, and it was always a favorite
with him, and now he clapped his little
hands. This was an unintentional signal,
and there was such a round of applause
that the whole thing was repeated.</p>

<p>The next picture showed Jacob
wrestling with the angel; and in the following
one, Jacob, kneeling, receives the
desired blessing. Then came a series of
comic pictures, which made everybody
laugh. Then the words "Good-night"
were thrown on the screen in immense letters,
and it grew light in the church as
suddenly as it had before grown dark,
making everybody rub his eyes on account
of the sudden glare.</p>

<p>The people all began to hurry out as if
it were necessary to reach home without a
moment's delay. Winnie soon joined her
family, and in a short time the "Green
Line" had taken them all home.</p>

<p>Ralph rubbed his sleepy eyes as he said
his evening prayer, but was not too sleepy
to thank God for his nice birthday.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>ERNESTINE.</small></h2>


<div class="floatl">
  <img class="plain" src="images/i45.jpg" width="153" height="217" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap16">
<span class="smcaps"><span class="invisible">"M</span>amma,"</span>
asked Ernestine
Alroy, "may I
ask the girls to have
their next meeting
here and take tea
with us?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Alroy looked
at her daughter with
some hesitation as
she said: "Ernestine, you know I would
like to please you, but have you sufficiently
considered the matter? All of
your friends are very comfortably situated,
and it will be impossible for us to entertain
them as they do you. Besides, I
cannot be at home until after six, and it
will make tea very late."</p>

<p>"I know all that, mamma, but I am
sure I can make them have a pleasant
time. I do not think we ought to be
<a class="pagenum" name="page_46" title="46"> </a>
ashamed of being poor, when we think
of the One who 'had not where to lay
His head.' For your sake, poor mamma,
I wish we had more money; but as for
myself, I feel just as happy as if we were
worth millions. I don't care a bit whether
my friends have money or not, and I don't
see why it should make any difference to
anybody."</p>

<p>"My poor child!" said her mother, and
she sighed as she remembered that at
Ernestine's age she had never even seen
apartments so poorly furnished as theirs,
"you have much to learn; you will find
that there are many people in the world
to whom it will make a great deal of difference."</p>

<p>"Well, mamma, we don't care for the
Madame Mucklegrands of the world, and
Winnie Burton and all of her folks are as
'real folks' as any in Mrs. Whitney's
book. Do let us have them!"</p>

<p>"Well, dear, I don't exactly like to
have you accept hospitalities which we are
not willing to return, and if you think
you can make it pleasant for your friends,
you shall do as you wish."</p>

<p>The next day, therefore, Ernestine told
the four girls that her mother sent her
compliments and would be much pleased
to have them to tea on Friday evening.
In the afternoon the girls all accepted,
and Fannie said that if agreeable to Mrs.
Alroy, her father would call for them at
nine o'clock and see them home.</p>

<p>After school that day, as Fannie and
Ernestine were walking down Court
Street together, they met a little girl,
dirty and uncombed, carrying a basket of
soiled clothes. Two of the boys of their
class, racing wildly down the street, boy-fashion,
ran against the child, upset the
basket, and the clothes, not being very
tightly packed, fell out. There was quite
a strong wind, and some of the napkins
and handkerchiefs lying loose on top were
caught up and sent blowing here, there
and everywhere.</p>

<p>The boys ran on, totally indifferent, if
not unconscious. The child, commencing
to cry, gave chase to the wind-blown
articles, and the basket rolled entirely
over, and nearly every article fell out.</p>

<p>Fannie stood laughing, her sense of the
ridiculous overcoming any pity she might
have felt for the girl. Ernestine hesitated
a moment. She was daintiness itself, and
the sight of the soiled clothes, belonging
to no one knew whom, was not an attractive
one. But for three years she had been
earnestly striving to follow the Golden
Rule, so she righted the basket, picked up
the soiled clothes, rolled them together
more tightly, and replaced them in the
basket by the time the child returned with
the recaptured napkins. She also helped
put these in, and with a few kind words
sent the girl on her way far happier than
she would have been if obliged to struggle
with her burden alone.</p>

<p>Fannie had moved on some distance,
much ashamed of being mixed up in such
a scene to even so slight a degree, and
feeling inclined to leave Ernestine entirely,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_47" title="47"> </a>
for she knew that her mother would
have characterized the whole affair as
"plebeian," and she felt half angry with
Ernestine.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="images/i47.jpg" width="482" height="628" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">Ernestine righted the basket.&mdash;See page 46.</p>
</div>

<p>When the latter rejoined
her, she said
with some irritation,
"However could you
touch those horrid,
dirty clothes or go near
that dirty child?"</p>

<p>"I didn't like to
touch them," said Ernestine
simply; "but
Christ did a great
many things he did not
like to do."</p>

<p>"Well, you are a
queer girl, Ernestine!
I'm sure I can't make
up my mind that it is
my duty to be pleasant
to every dirty little
beggar who comes
along. There might
have been small-pox in
those clothes!"</p>

<p>Ernestine smiled at
that, but made no reply,
and the two
walked on in silence till they reached the
corner where they separated.</p>

<p>Fannie went on, swinging her books by
the strap, and thinking that dirt could not
be so repulsive to Ernestine as to her; but
if she could have seen Ernestine go
straight to the kitchen sink the minute
she reached home, before she stopped to
touch anything, Fannie might have realized
something of the self-restraint her
friend had exercised in the matter. But
few of us can be brought to believe that
things we find unpleasant are often quite
as unpleasant to other people.</p>

<p>Friday afternoon came, and five o'clock
found the four girls entering a side yard
in a pleasant if not an aristocratic neighborhood.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_48" title="48"> </a>
They went up the stairs leading
from a side hall, and were met at the
top by Ernestine, who was holding open
the door.</p>

<p>She led them into a tiny bedroom, not
much larger than a closet, but scrupulously
dainty and clean, from the white
spread and pillows on the bed to the fresh
towels hanging on the rack above the
washstand.</p>

<p>Here she helped the girls remove their
wraps, and then they went into the adjoining
room, which was a pleasant surprise,
particularly to Fannie. So pretty and
pleasant and homelike it appeared that, at
first, it almost seemed elegant, until one
had time to observe that there was not an
expensive article in the room. The floor
was covered with a blue and white
checked matting, the chairs and rockers
were simply "cane," and the only piece
of upholstered furniture was the lounge.
But there were some engravings, plainly
framed; hanging baskets at both of the
windows; a window-box of lilies-of-the-valley,
just beginning to bloom, and in
the other window a similar box of mignonette,
which filled the whole room with
its delicate fragrance.</p>

<p>A bright fire blazed in the grate, and
the four girls felt at home more quickly
than they had done at either of the two
places of their previous meetings, probably
because Ernestine was their only
hostess, her mother not yet having returned
from the store.</p>

<p>A late magazine lay on the table, together
with a copy of that charming story,
"Little Lord Fauntleroy," and Mrs.
Whitney's "We Girls" and "Real
Folks." Winnie could not help picking
them up to see what they were, and it
turned out that all of the girls except
Gretta had read them, so they immediately
began talking about them.</p>

<p>"Mamma and papa and brother Jack
took turns in reading 'Fauntleroy' aloud
to us when it came out in the magazine,"
said Winnie, "and for a day or two in
each month we hardly talked of anything
else."</p>

<p>"I liked the scene of the dinner party
best, when the little lord talked to the
guests, but stayed close beside the pretty
lady and paid her such cunning compliments,"
said Fannie.</p>

<p>"I enjoyed reading about him in the
grocery store with Mr. Hobbs," said
Miriam. "I can see them now; Hobbs
was so funny! My sister said he was
more of a child than the little hero of the
story."</p>

<p>"I think I liked him best when he was
with his grandfather," said Ernestine; "it
was lovely of him to think that wicked
old man was so good."</p>

<p>"My mother says that every child in
the land, and particularly every boy,
ought to read that story, if for no other
reason than to learn what it is to be a real
gentleman and a real lady. She says no
depths of poverty could ever have made
'Dearest' and her son anything else."</p>

<p>"I was just about frantic," said Fannie,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_49" title="49"> </a>
"when I began to be afraid he wasn't
the heir after all. It seemed horrid to
think that that rough woman's son should
own those fine lands and the title, and I
felt almost as glad when it turned out all
right as if he had been one of my nearest
friends."</p>

<p>"I wish I read more," said Gretta. "I
do love my music; and if I didn't, I'd have
to keep it up all the same. But I would
like to read the book you are talking
about."</p>

<p>"You may take it," said Ernestine,
"and keep it just as long as you wish."</p>

<p>"Speaking of borrowing books," said
Miriam, "reminds me that I did the most
dreadful thing to-day. Miss Carter had
lent me Mrs. Gaskel's 'Life of Charlotte
Bronte,' and I had just returned it
yesterday, feeling very grateful, for I
think it is nice in Miss Carter to take an
interest in so many girls. I should think
she would just get to hating us, for it is
the same thing year in and year out, and
most of us are so trying.</p>

<p>"But although I love her dearly, you
know how angry she gets, and she was
giving Josie Thompson such a lecture
about there being no punctuation in her
composition, and then she read a paragraph
as it was punctuated&mdash;just 'like
commas and periods shaken out of a pepper-box,'
she said. The subject was 'Joan
of Arc,' and Josie, as usual, had rather a
mixed idea of her character, and what
Miss Carter read sounded something like
this:</p>

<p>"'Joan of Arc, was a poor, girl who
heard a great many, ghost stories and
these turned her head and she imagined,
that, it would be a great deal more fun
to lead soldiers. To battle in the war.
With England than to be spending her
time tending sheep? on the mountains
she thought she would enjoy herself better.'</p>

<p>"That last was so much like Josie&mdash;who,
as you know, is always talking about
enjoying herself&mdash;that I could hardly
keep in, and when Josie made a mouth
at Miss Carter the minute her back was
turned, three or four of us giggled out
loud, and Miss Carter stopped lecturing
Josie and turned her wrath on us.</p>

<p>"That was yesterday, but this morning
the whole affair was still fresh in my memory,
and three or four of the girls in
Miss Brownlow's room happening to come
about the same time that I did, I began
to tell them about it. I began in a high
key, a great deal worse than Miss Carter
ever uses, although she does pitch her
voice very high when she is vexed. I
said:</p>

<p>"'Miss Thompson, I am surprised at
you; in fact, I am more than surprised.
It almost passes belief that a girl should
begin to study punctuation almost as soon
as her school life begins, as in our schools,
and after six or seven years should not be
able even to use a period, to say nothing
of the more complicated marks; to know
nothing, absolutely nothing, of her own
language.'</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_50" title="50"> </a>
"Here I interrupted myself to show
them the kind of mouth Josie made, and
of course they all laughed, for they know
how her mouth and nose go up at every
little thing. Then I went on.</p>

<p>"Miss Carter didn't see the mouth
that Josie made, and she caught us laughing,
and said, 'Can it be possible that
there are girls in this class, girls of good
rank and standing, and of moderately
good behavior, who can laugh, yes, actually
laugh, at the ignorance of one of their
school-mates? Something is wrong,
radically wrong,'&mdash;and here I made the
gesture she always makes when she says
'radically wrong,' and&mdash;what do you
think? There she stood, right behind
me!"</p>

<p>"What did she do?" asked Fannie.</p>

<p>"Do? She didn't do anything, and I
half thought she was smiling. But I felt
as if I would like to sink through the
floor, I was so mortified. And only yesterday
I was walking down the street with
her, talking to her as if I thought her my
best friend! She'll think I'm a perfect
hypocrite."</p>

<p>"Why don't you apologize?" asked
Gretta.</p>

<p>"I can't go and apologize to someone
for making fun of her as soon as her back
is turned, can I? And I really didn't intend
to make fun of Miss Carter, either;
it was only that the whole affair seemed
amusing to me."</p>

<p>"She probably understands, and does
not think any more about it," said Ernestine.
"But now, if you'll excuse me, I'll
have to go into the kitchen for a few
minutes; or perhaps you'll come, too."</p>

<p>"Oh, we'd like to come, if we won't be
in the way," said Fannie. So they all
trooped into the kitchen.</p>

<p>What a tiny box of a place it was, to be
sure! When all five of the girls were
there, there was not room for anybody
else. Fannie and Gretta squeezed close
to each other on the box beside the window,
Miriam sat on a chair in one corner,
and Winnie stood in the doorway between
the two rooms, watching Ernestine,
and thinking how cross she had been only
a week or two before because she had to
do a little cooking in the morning, while
Ernestine had to do it every day and go to
school beside.</p>

<p>But Ernestine did everything so easily
and pleasantly that it was a pleasure to
watch her. She did her cooking on a little
oil stove, and there seemed so little to
be done&mdash;for Mrs. Alroy and Ernestine
had prepared things the day before&mdash;that
her young visitors could not feel as if it
were a bit of trouble to entertain them.
It was as nice as a play, too, to see her
cut the potatoes in delicate, thin slices and
drop them into the boiling fat, and see
them come out delightfully crisp and
brown.</p>

<p>Then the girls all followed her into the
sitting-room, laughing and chattering as
only girls can, while Ernestine set the
table. The table linen was white and
fine, and the cups and saucers were real
<a class="pagenum" name="page_51" title="51"> </a>
old china, these being about the only
things which Mrs. Alroy had saved from
her past grandeur.</p>

<p>Everything was ready and on the table,
except the food which was to be served
hot, when Mrs. Alroy came in, looking
tired and reserved. She disappeared for a
few moments into the bedroom, and when
she came out, seeming somewhat refreshed,
they all sat down to the table.</p>

<p>To the surprise of the girls, Ernestine,
in her simple, unaffected manner, asked
a blessing on what was set before them.
It seemed queer to them that if it were
to be done at all, it should not be by Mrs.
Alroy. But Ernestine's mother was not
yet perfectly resigned to what had come
upon her, and it was that, perhaps&mdash;yes,
certainly&mdash;which made her burden so
hard to bear; but at least she did not interfere
with Ernestine in these matters.</p>

<p>The girls were hungry, and everything
tasted delicious, from the sliced cold ham
and the potatoes which they had seen
Ernestine frying, to the dessert of ice-cream
and cake.</p>

<p>When supper was over, the girls begged
to be allowed to clear off the table, and
Ernestine washed the dishes as they
brought them out, while Winnie wiped
them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alroy sat down and glanced over
the newspaper. Fannie watched her curiously,
and privately came to the conclusion
that she was the proudest woman she
had ever seen. This conviction came to
her with something of a shock, for she
had heretofore supposed that pride and
wealth and fine living belonged together.
She furthermore came to the conclusion
that while pride might be fine, it was not
especially charming, for though Mrs.
Alroy had been pleasant when the girls
were presented to her, her manner had
been only polite, not interested.</p>

<p>When the girls had finished washing
and putting away the supper things, she
roused herself and talked with them about
their school and amusements, but as soon
as Ernestine returned, excused herself and
went into the little room and closed the
door. Ernestine followed her, with a
troubled look on her usually calm face.
When she returned, she said:</p>

<p>"Mamma has a severe headache, and
begs to be excused for awhile, but hopes to
feel better before you go home."</p>

<p>"We were all to have a text or a verse
to-night, weren't we?" asked Fannie.
"The only thing I could find was our
Golden Text for last Sunday, 'Remember
now thy Creator in the days of thy youth.'
I spoke to papa about it, and, although he
is not very religious, he said he didn't believe
there was any better way of remembering
our Creator than by trying to do
what was right, and he was glad to see
that I was thinking about such things."</p>

<p>"Mamma says there are very few things
said in the Bible about the dangers of
delay," said Winnie, "but she gave me
this one from Proverbs: 'Boast not thyself
of to-morrow, for thou knowest not
what a day may bring forth.'"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_52" title="52"> </a>
"I couldn't find anything in the Bible,"
said Miriam, "but I found a poem by
Adelaide Procter which I copied, thinking
you might like to hear it all, as I
scarcely knew which verse to select. I
will read it to you:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent0">"Rise! for the day is passing,</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">And you lie dreaming on;</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">The others have buckled their armor,</div>

      <div class="verse indent0">A place in the ranks awaits you,</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">Each man has some part to play;</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">The Past and the Future are nothing,</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">In the face of the stern To-day.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent0">"Rise from your dreams of the Future,&mdash;</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">Of gaining some hard-fought field;</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">Of storming some airy fortress,</div>

      <div class="verse indent1">The sound that you scarcely hear,</div>

      <div class="verse indent1">You may wake to find it past!"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>"How much better we understand
things than we did three months ago!"
said Winnie. "I used to dream of
the grand things I was going to do
when I grew up." Then she added, blushing
a little as she remembered her cross
Saturday morning, "I do yet, sometimes,
but I don't think I neglect quite so many
things as I used to."</p>

<p>"I never had much chance either to
neglect things or to dream," said Gretta,
"for papa or mamma or my sister was
always reminding me that it was time to
do this or that or the other. But I am
beginning now to think of some of my
faults. I couldn't find anything for this
afternoon, except the Memory Gem we
learned in the First Reader. You know I
don't read a great deal myself, and we all
seem to have so much to do at our house;
when it isn't something else, it's practice,
practice, practice! Even this little verse
I don't suppose I should have remembered
if I hadn't heard the children reciting it
at the 'Colony':</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent0">"One thing at a time,</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">And that done well,</div>
      <div class="verse indent0">Is a very good rule,</div>
      <div class="verse indent1">As many can tell."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>"Why, that's the very thing, Gretta!
I'm surprised that none of the rest of us
thought of it. How queer that the same
piece of advice, in one form or another,
has been given to us ever since we were
little girls, and that we have just begun
to realize what it all means!" said Fannie.</p>

<p>"What have you, Ernestine?" said
Miriam.</p>

<p>"I took mine from Ecclesiastes," was
the reply. "'When thou vowest a vow
unto the Lord, defer not to pay it.'"</p>

<p>"I like that, too," said Gretta; "but I
think Miss Benton's pretty card is helping
me more than anything else."</p>

<p>"I think that was lovely, too," said
Fannie. "I liked the story ever so much,
but it will be nice for us to do as she suggested,
and take a motto this week. How
would it do to take the one Winnie
brought? It seems the easiest for us to
understand."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_53" title="53"> </a>
So they all learned it, and, at Miriam's
suggestion, added the verse that Gretta
had recited.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alroy came back into the sitting-room
just as the girls had finished reading
their mottoes, and, though her eyes
looked heavy, as if she were suffering, she
joined the little band, and told them that
she thought they were adopting a very
good plan to help them over the rough
places of life, and perhaps also enable
them to make fewer mistakes than they
might otherwise do.</p>

<p>While she was talking to them, footsteps
were heard coming up the stairs.</p>

<p>"That's papa, I think," said Fannie,
and she went with Ernestine to the door.</p>

<p>Ernestine had seen Mr. Allen often, for
he was one of the trustees of their school,
but of course Mrs. Alroy had never met
him, so the girls led him through the narrow
hall into the room beyond.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alroy met him at the door and extended
her hand, as Fannie said, "My
papa, Mrs. Alroy."</p>

<p>Mr. Allen seated himself, at Mrs. Alroy's
invitation, while the girls went to
get on their wraps. As they talked of the
weather and the usual subjects discussed
by strangers, Mr. Allen looked at the lady
in rather a puzzled manner, as if wondering
where he had seen her before. Finally
he said:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Mrs. Alroy, but may I ask
what was your maiden name?"</p>

<p>She told him, but rather coldly, as if
she considered the question impertinent.</p>

<p>He read her thought well enough, but
unhesitatingly continued:</p>

<p>"The Van Ortons of New York?"</p>

<p>"Of New York, yes."</p>

<p>"I thought so; it must be one of your
brothers whom you so strongly resemble.
I could not think whom you were like, the
day of the celebration over at the school-house,
but that, I see, was what puzzled
me. I know your brother and his family
quite well. I have had business relations
with him for years, which have been very
pleasant ones."</p>

<p>"I am glad to meet someone who has
seen my brother recently. I have seen no
member of my family for years; it has
been impossible for me to go home, and
my circumstances have been such that I
have managed to prevent their visiting
me, for I had no desire to have them do
so. Should you have any communication
with him, I ask as a favor that my name
may not be mentioned."</p>

<p>"Your wishes, of course, will be respected,
madam," the gentleman replied
courteously.</p>

<p>The girls appeared at this moment,
ready for the walk home, and Mr. Allen
rose, adding:</p>

<p>"Permit me to thank you for the pleasure
you have given my daughter, and to
express the wish that you will allow her to
make a return soon." Then they took
their departure.</p>

<p>Ernestine went into the little kitchen
to prepare things for breakfast, and when
she came back she was shocked to find her
<a class="pagenum" name="page_54" title="54"> </a>
mother sobbing violently. It frightened
her, too, for though her mother was never
very cheerful, the girl seldom saw her
shed tears.</p>

<p>"Mother dear, what is it?" she said.
"Have I been selfish? Was the evening
too much for you?"</p>

<p>"Selfish? No, dear," was the reply.
"I am the selfish one, and I am grateful
to know that you have such perfect faith
and hope that all is well. Otherwise your
young life would have been darkened long
ago by my constant sorrow and regret.
Poor child! It is a hard life for one so
young."</p>

<p>"But, mother, some day you will be
happy again."</p>

<p>"I hope so, dear," replied Mrs. Alroy.
But she thought to herself that there was
nothing in this world that could make
life endurable to her, unless she could forget.
And that, to her proud, sensitive
nature, seemed impossible.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>EASTER-TIDE.</small></h2>


<div class="floatl">
  <img class="plain" src="images/i54.jpg" width="173" height="180" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap16">
<span class="smcaps"><span class="invisible">"W</span>ell,"</span>
said Mrs. Allen
to her husband,
after they had gone
upstairs, "I hope
you're satisfied and
have had enough of
Fannie's visiting around at tenement
houses. Democratic ideas are all right
enough, theoretically, but I think it is impossible
for people to dwell long in poverty
without losing refinement."</p>

<p>"Some kinds of poverty, yes; and some
kinds of people, yes. That comfort and
luxury are refining in their influence goes
without saying; but just as there are some
people whom all the wealth in the world
could never raise above vulgarity, so there
are others whom poverty could never degrade.
And the lady and her little girl
whom Fannie has visited to-night are of
this type. They are the kind of people
who will have the refinements of life
even at the expense of some of its comforts."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that is queer talk.
How can people have refinements without
comforts?"</p>

<p>"Had you been at Mrs. Alroy's to-night,
I think you would understand how
that could be. And as for the rest," Mr.
Allen added dryly, "Mrs. Alroy is one of
the Van Ortons of New York."</p>

<p>"The Van Ortons of New York!" and
Mrs. Allen dropped into her chair in astonishment,
for the Van Ortons were people
whom she was glad to visit. "How
do you know?"</p>

<p>"Her resemblance to her brother puzzled
me, and, wondering where I could
have met her, I asked her maiden name."</p>

<p>"Why, I must call upon her soon."</p>

<p>"I think you'd better not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who's the aristocrat now, I wonder!"</p>

<p>"&mdash;because," he added, as if he had
not heard the interruption, "she would
consider it an intrusion. Her pride has
<a class="pagenum" name="page_55" title="55"> </a>
been made as hard and cold as ice by her
misfortunes, and I'm afraid nothing will
ever melt it."</p>

<p>This was another new idea to Mrs.
Allen. It seemed as if new things, starting
with the little folks, were destined to
be contagious. That a woman who lived
in three small rooms and who supported
herself and her daughter by selling goods
across a counter, should resent a visit from
a person so well known as herself, was
somewhat startling to the lady.</p>

<p>"Well," she said impatiently, "what
are you and your philanthropy going to
do about it?"</p>

<p>"I think it is a case which my philanthropy,
as you choose to call it, cannot
reach. I know that her people would
gladly have her come home, and there is
no reason why they should be ashamed of
either her or her daughter; but she manages
to keep them in complete ignorance
of her circumstances, and also, I strongly
suspect, of her whereabouts."</p>

<p>"Why don't you write to them?"</p>

<p>"She has forbidden it, and in such a
way as to make me feel that it would be a
breach of honor to disregard her wishes.
No, nothing can be done at present. But
she is as frail as a reed, and her body, in
spite of her will power, will break down
under the pressure, and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Then she will die&mdash;that is all."</p>


<p class="margtop2">It seems hard, at first thought, to bring
the sorrows of older people&mdash;and sorrows,
too, for which, as the words of Mr.
Allen would indicate the above to be,
there seems no earthly cure&mdash;into
a book for girls; but perhaps it is, after
all, a truer kindness to let them find out,
while there is yet time, that life is a thing
of earnest and real import, and that the
impossible ideas of a romantic world
where a few sorrows come simply as contrast,
and then vanish forever, leaving the
heroes and heroines surrounded by an
everlasting halo of happiness and prosperity&mdash;which
so many of the lighter
novels teach&mdash;are more injurious than
any statistics will ever show. They give
views of life which, if followed out, as in
the case of Constance Van Orton, are apt
to end in sorrow and despair.</p>

<p>But the saddest life must have some joy
in it, and Mrs. Alroy probably had
many happy hours, when she enjoyed the
sunshine, or, in more sober moods, the
gentle patter of the rain on the roof, her
books (to which the poorest of those who
live in our large cities can have access
through the public libraries), and, above
all, the companionship of her daughter,
who was really that most remarkable of
characters, a child good, and even pious,
without priggishness or the slightest taint
of affectation.</p>

<p>And when all is thought and felt and
suffered, above earth's joys and woes
and hopes and dark despair is God, the
eternal Good, and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">What to us is darkness, to Him is light,</div>
      <div class="verse">And the end He knoweth."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_56" title="56"> </a>
And so the days rolled on and brought
the anniversary of Christ's suffering and
death and resurrection. The Burton
family kept Easter with great rejoicing.
They exchanged presents of pots of
flowers, ferns and Easter lilies, mignonette
and roses, which made the house fragrant
and beautiful. The children received
from their parents and friends at a distance
Easter cards; and colored eggs, in
which Ralph delighted, were not forgotten.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton and Winnie, also, on the
day previous, did their share toward
decorating the church they attended.
There was always a big pyramid of
bouquets on the pulpit stand, which were
taken down after service and distributed
to the children of the Sunday-school. It
was a great treat to the children to go to
church on this day and join in the responsive
service and hear the joyful anthems.
This Easter Day was no exception to previous
ones, in point of joy and thanksgiving.</p>

<p>There were some little extra surprises
at the Burton home, among them being
a panel of Easter lilies and maidenhair
fern, painted in oil for Mrs. Burton by her
sister Kitty; and from the same source
Winnie received a smaller one of lilies-of-the-valley
and wild violets, with the motto
below: "Take my yoke upon you, and
learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in
heart: and ye shall find rest unto your
souls." In the afternoon they held a service
of their own in the sitting-room. Mrs.
Burton and Aunt Kitty sang Abt's duet,
"Easter Day," and they had two or three
fine quartettes.</p>

<p>Norah had not been forgotten, either,
in the distribution of the flowers, or in an
invitation to join the family circle in the
afternoon. She was anxious to do something
in return, and so had prepared another
surprise which greeted them at tea-time.
On each plate lay an egg, which,
when examined, was found to be a wooden
candy-box, full of home-made candies.
All were pleased, even to grandma and
Mr. Burton, and Norah's face shone with
delight when she saw that her gifts were
appreciated.</p>

<p>It had been a long day for Ralph, however,
and Winnie and Jack stayed at home
with him while the other members of the
family went to evening service. The
child was tired and restless, yet too much
excited to be sleepy, and was very unwilling
to go to bed when the usual hour arrived.
Winnie was quite weary, too, but
she dared not allow herself to be impatient
on a day like this, so she told him
Bible stories and sang to him, and at last
the heavy eyelids closed, and she was at
liberty to go downstairs with her book.</p>

<p>This time it was "Pilgrim's Progress,"
which she was reading for about the
dozenth time. She dropped, with a sense
of luxury, into the same big chair in
which we have seen her on a former occasion.
Jack also had an interesting book,
and they read on in perfect silence for
half an hour, when suddenly they heard
<a class="pagenum" name="page_57" title="57"> </a>
a crash, and then Ralph's voice in a
frightened cry.</p>

<p>Dropping their books, they ran upstairs.
Jack turned up the gas, and they found
that poor little Ralph had rolled out of
bed, and was lying stretched on the floor,
but far more frightened than hurt. He
said he had had bad dreams, and they
could not quiet him nor induce him to go
back to bed. At last Jack wrapped him
up in a shawl, and Winnie sat down in the
big chair and took the frightened child in
her arms.</p>

<p>Jack settled himself again with his
book and forgot all about them both, until
his father and mother came home and
found them asleep. Mrs. Burton's face
showed disapproval until Jack explained
the circumstances, and she could then enjoy
the pretty picture they made, without
feeling a regret that it was the result of
disobedience.</p>

<p>Jack took Ralph in his arms and once
more carried him, still sleeping soundly,
upstairs. They did not waken Winnie
until it was time for them all to go to bed,
when she was gently roused by her
mother. She looked around in bewilderment,
and it was some time before she
could realize what had happened.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<small>A VISIT TO THE ZOO.</small></h2>


<p class="firstlargenoindent">
<span class="smcaps"><span class="firstlarge">T</span>he</span>
days were growing longer and
pleasanter. The trees were all dressed
in green now, and the maples in front of
the Burton home bent their green boughs
and shook their leaves at the invitation of
every little zephyr.</p>

<p>The evening star shone over the western
hills, followed closely by the slender
new moon. The sun sank to rest behind
those same hills, some nights gorgeously
attended by crimson and gold and purple
clouds; on other evenings, dropping out of
sight suddenly, as if in a hurry to get to
China, as Winnie was fond of telling
Ralph.</p>

<p>Winnie often sat with Ralph on the
front steps these days, and showed him
the bright star and tried to explain to
him that it was a big world, perhaps full
of people; or she would put on her
roller skates and skate up and down the
flagged pavement, while he rode his velocipede.</p>

<p>Winnie thought she had never known a
spring so beautiful as this one. She felt
as if she could stay out of doors forever,
and found it even harder to keep her resolution
of conquering self-indulgence and
sticking to her duties now than when
she liked so much to sit by a bright fire
and read.</p>

<p>She had her pretty card and her motto
in the looking-glass in her room, but she
found it so hard to remember&mdash;or to
want to remember, perhaps, which every
one knows is quite a different thing&mdash;that
she pinned a little piece of stiff paper
with the word "Now" written on it, inside
her dress. On the whole, however,
she kept pretty well to her resolution of
<a class="pagenum" name="page_58" title="58"> </a>
having a time for everything and doing
everything in its time.</p>

<p>But she had never before felt such a desire
to be out of doors, and she imagined
she heard fairies beckoning to her from
the woods and hills. So one day, when
Aunt Kitty came over and invited Ralph
and herself and the other four girls of her
little band to go to the Zoological Garden
the next Saturday, the girl's delight was
unbounded, and she was in a fever lest
something should happen to prevent their
going.</p>

<p>She delivered her message to the other
girls. Miriam and Fannie at once said
they thought they could go, but Ernestine
did not feel sure she could arrange her
Saturday duties so that no extra burden
would fall on her mother, while Gretta
told them she would have to ask her
father to excuse her from the extra practice
on Saturday, as they were to take
their lunches and stay all day.</p>

<p>Fortunately Gretta found her father in
very good humor. She had been making
excellent progress with her music, and
he was very willing she should have a
holiday. Ernestine, also, had arranged
with one of the neighbors in the building
to take care of her little children on the
succeeding Saturday, in return for her
help in doing some extra household work.</p>

<p>Saturday turned out to be a warm,
pleasant day, and in their eagerness the
girls arrived at the Burtons' a little ahead
of time, and had to wait till Miss Benton
came, which she did soon, looking very
happy. As for Ralph, his eyes were as
bright as stars, and he was the very picture
of joy and good humor.</p>

<p>They walked up to Elm Street, and
from there took the car to the Mt. Bellevue
inclined railway. When they entered
the car of the latter, all stood at the front
end of it and looked out of the window,
and had the strange sensation, which no
familiarity therewith seems quite to
deaden, of being lifted suddenly into another
region, and of seeing the great city
sinking down, down, until one wonders
where it is going. Then, all at once, the
car stopped with its usual jerk, and there
they were, at the top of the hill.</p>

<p>There were very few people about the
Bellevue House. They took a walk
around the grounds and through the
building, and stood looking at the city,
covered with its workaday smoke from the
many manufactories, till it almost seemed
as if it were seen through a cloud.</p>

<p>"How strange it is," said Miriam, as
they entered the street-car at the top of
the hill, "to see the houses just as close
together here, and to have it seem like a
city of itself, and yet so different from the
business part of Cincinnati below that it
is hard to imagine the two are any part
of each other!"</p>

<p>"There is something strange about
such things," said Miss Benton. "It is
just like people's lives. Their daily business,
which brings them bread and butter,
and which is really the largest and most
important part of existence, seems to sink
<a class="pagenum" name="page_59" title="59"> </a>
into insignificance or to be forgotten altogether
when social relations are taken up.
But, after all, I like to live in the city itself,
where there is something of the past
lingering about. Everything seems so
new here."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Ernestine. "I
think I would like to live up here; the air
seems so much purer. But I would want
a bigger yard than these, where I might
have a garden."</p>

<p>"It's cleaner, too, up here," said practical
Gretta, who was neatness itself. "I
visit my aunt on Vine Street Hill, and
things always looks so much nicer and
newer at her house than the same ones at
ours. And it isn't because we don't try,
for we do twice the amount of work; my
mother and sister are always going about
with a duster." And Gretta, who had
made a long speech for her, finished with
a sigh, at which they all laughed.</p>

<p>"Gretta would like a house where
everything had a glass cover," said
Miriam. "As for me, I like things jolly
and comfortable, and if they get grimy
and sooty, and nobody's to blame, what's
the use of making one's self unhappy
about it? I'm afraid I'm a good deal like
Josie Thompson, for I do like to enjoy
myself."</p>

<p>"Well, no two of us are alike, and I
don't think it was intended that we should
be," said Miss Benton. "That is what
makes the charm of people's houses&mdash;that
they should all partake of the individuality
of their owners. When I enter
even a little girl's room, I like to see some
signs of her ownership there, and not have
it all as her mother or older sister or the
maid arranged it. I like to see something
that looks as if she had an object in life,
if it is nothing more than a charm string
of buttons, (which, by the way, has gone
out of fashion, I believe,) or a scrapbook."</p>

<p>"Well, then, Aunt Kitty," said Winnifred,
smiling at her own thought, "it
must be a treat for you to go into Uncle
Fred's room; for, if I were to see such a
room at the North Pole, I would think of
him."</p>

<p>"Well," said Miss Benton, with a smile,
"I might enjoy it better if it were in
some other house. I think, in this case,
it must be that familiarity breeds contempt.
The fact is, girls, my brother's
room is more of an old curiosity shop than
a modern sleeping-room. He has always
had a sort of magpie-habit of storing
things away, and is continually having
some new hobby; and as his hobbies are
often changed, and each hobby is apt to
take the form of making some sort of collection,
he has queer things lying about.
But from the time he was quite a little
boy, mother always said, 'Oh, let him
have that,' or 'do the other, and he'll be
satisfied at home.'"</p>

<p>"How many canes and walking-sticks
has he, Aunt Kitty?"</p>

<p>"Eight, I think, and each one has a
history; and two or three of them a mystery,
which he refuses to divulge. But
<a class="pagenum" name="page_60" title="60"> </a>
here we are at the end of our journey, and
Fannie hasn't had an opportunity to open
her mouth."</p>

<p>"It's probably very good for my tongue
to get a rest; it works quite steadily as a
usual thing&mdash;at least so my father says.
But if Ralph hadn't been all eyes, this
would have been dull for him."</p>

<p>"I isn't all eyes!" said Ralph, indignantly.</p>

<p>They now approached the entrance to
the Zoological Garden, and the girls once
more took out their pocket books; but
Miss Benton was ahead of them again,
and had settled for the party before there
was time to demur.</p>

<p>The first thing they spied were the
mounds of the prairie dogs, and they
stood watching these a long time. It was
such fun to see the little animals running
in and out of their holes and to hear their
funny bark, which Miriam said was "the
best part of them, and probably very much
better than their bite."</p>

<p>Our little party was fortunate enough
to be at the cages of the carnivora just at
feeding time. The great lions lay basking
in the sun and looking so innocent
and amiable that it was almost impossible
to imagine they could be at all dangerous,
when suddenly the man who fed them appeared
with the raw meat. Then their
roars were fairly appalling, and made the
whole crowd jump, while Ralph clung
tight to the hand of Aunt Kitty, who said:</p>

<p>"I was just thinking how nice it would
be to pat that quiet, majestic fellow on
the head, as I would my Angora cat; but
I think I'll wait till he's had his dinner."</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt Kitty," said Ralph, "I
'ouldn't let you; he'd eat you up!"</p>

<p>It was an exciting but rather terrible
pleasure to see the wild creatures quarreling
and growling and fighting over their
dinners, and was also a most effective object
lesson on greediness.</p>

<p>Like other visitors, although Miss Kitty
laughed at them for it, our little party followed
the keeper around from one cage
to another as he fed the various animals.</p>

<p>"I like the bears best," said Fannie.
"They look like Eskimos when they stand
on their hind legs, and they stare up at us
and the other people as if we were here
just for them to look at."</p>

<p>"There is a something within me that,
in spite of bears and all their attractions,
tells me it must be dinner time," said Miss
Benton, taking out her watch. "Yes, it
is one o'clock; suppose we get our
baskets."</p>

<p>Ralph, in particular, manifested great
approval of this part of the programme,
and, having selected a nice grassy spot,
they disposed of themselves as comfortably
as possible, each with her basket at
her side.</p>

<p>As they opened the baskets, passing the
thin sandwiches and pickles, Winnie made
a suggestion.</p>

<p>"Aunt Kitty, let's play 'I have a
thought.'"</p>

<p>"Very well," replied the lady; and, after
a short explanation of the game, and a
<a class="pagenum" name="page_61" title="61"> </a>
little time to think, she announced the
fact that she had a thought.</p>

<p>"Why is it like the sky?" asked Winnie.</p>

<p>"Because it is round."</p>

<p>"Why is it like a bear?" asked Miriam,
her thoughts still on the bear pit.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;oh, Miriam, that is a hard
one!&mdash;because it is sometimes white."</p>

<p>"Why is it like me?" said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Because everybody likes it when it is
good." And Ralph wondered why they
all laughed.</p>

<p>"Why is it like the grass?" asked Ernestine.</p>

<p>"Because it is greenest in the spring."</p>

<p>Then the questions poured upon Miss
Benton rapidly, as the girls began to see
how the game was played.</p>

<p>"Why is it like music?" asked Gretta.</p>

<p>"Because it suggests pleasant
thoughts."</p>

<p>"Why is it like a novel?"</p>

<p>"It is often highly flavored."</p>

<p>"Why is it like an egg?"</p>

<p>"Because it is an article of food."</p>

<p>"Why is it like a cream-puff?"</p>

<p>"Because the best part is inside."</p>

<p>"Why is it like cheese?" said Fannie,
putting a piece in her mouth.</p>

<p>"Because it comes on with the dessert."</p>

<p>"Why is it like a book?"</p>

<p>"Because the best part is usually between
the covers."</p>

<p>"Why is it like a ring?"</p>

<p>"Because people like to have a finger
in it."</p>

<p>At which there was a general shout,
and they all said: "A pie, of course!"</p>

<p>"But what kind of a pie, Miss Benton?"
asked Miriam.</p>

<p>"That you must find out, too," was the
laughing answer; and the questions went
on.</p>

<p>"It can't be lemon or custard or pumpkin,"
said Fannie, "because we know it
has two covers."</p>

<p>"Why is it like a flower?"</p>

<p>"Because it has various colors."</p>

<p>"And is greenest in the spring," said
Winnie, musingly. "Oh, it is an apple
pie! And Miss Benton acknowledged
that she had guessed correctly.</p>

<p>Then Ernestine and Gretta consulted,
and took a thought together. Their
thought was a geography lesson, and of
course the resemblances were most absurd,
and it required all the ingenuity the
two girls possessed to answer the questions.</p>

<p>They were all so occupied with the
game and their dinner that no one noticed
Miss Benton had not yet opened her
basket, and great was their surprise and
delight when she passed around to each of
them a grocer's thin platter filled with
strawberries, for they were still very
scarce, as it was early in the season.</p>

<p>After dinner, Miss Benton took out a
book and said she was going to read for
a while, so the girls walked around, taking
Ralph with them, and greatly enjoying
the admiration he excited by his pretty
dress, his beauty and his cunning speeches.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_62" title="62"> </a>
They too, however, soon found themselves
somewhat tired, so they went back
to Miss Benton, and, sitting down for a
rest, amused themselves by hunting for
four-leaved clovers. In this Winnie and
Miriam proved themselves the lucky ones.
Fannie had not the slightest success, till
finally she gave a little cry and held up a
clover.</p>

<p>But Miss Benton's quick eyes noticed a
twinkle in Fannie's, and saying, "Oh,
Fannie, I'm afraid you're a little cheat!"
she reached over and adroitly separated
one of the leaves from another, leaving
only a common clover leaf.</p>

<p>"Well," said Fannie, laughing at being
discovered so soon, "if I don't have good
luck, I'm not going to let everyone know
it. My father tells me to make up my
mind that lots of things will happen to me
in this world which I'll best conquer by
grinning and bearing them. And that's
what I'm going to do."</p>

<p>"A very good plan, my dear," said Miss
Benton, "for even if the grin is a sickly
one, it's better than a frown or a whine."</p>

<p>"I guess I don't do that way," said
Gretta, whose tongue and conscience both
seemed to be awaking. "I'm afraid I go
away and pout."</p>

<p>"The worst of habits," said Miss Benton,
with intentional decision. "That is
the habit which is most disagreeable to
everyone around, most full of unhappiness
to the one who indulges in it, and
the most difficult to break. I am afraid
that ill-temper is as powerful a giant as
procrastination, because it, too, assumes
so many forms; there are pouting and
whining, storming and scolding, and the
various other manifestations which we all,
more or less, indulge in. I do not think
many people cling to the powerful Giant
Hate, but it is 'the little foxes that spoil
the vines,' and little fits of temper, long
indulged in, might at last lead even to
that. But, girls, I didn't inveigle you out
here this lovely day to lecture you. So
come, let's be moving on."</p>

<p>They next went to the aviary. Here,
although they enjoyed looking at the
birds, they became more interested in a
party of children, boys and girls, each
one looking like the others, so far as
clothes were concerned. Of course they
must be from some charitable institution,
but the girls did not know which one.
Afterward, when our little company had
gone to the monkey house and found a
number of the same uniformed children,
Miss Benton said to one of them, "What
school is this, my dear?"</p>

<p>The child looked at her a moment in
surprise, and then replied: "Why, this
is the monkey school, I think."</p>

<p>"Where is the teacher?" asked Ralph,
who mistook both question and answer, as
the child herself had done.</p>

<p>Miriam and Fannie were delighted at
this, and, going up pretty close to one of
the cages, Fannie, who had yellow bangs,
said, pointing to a great monkey which
was watching them in a very observant
manner:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_63" title="63"> </a>
"I think this must be the teacher."</p>

<p>Just as she made the remark, the monkey
stretched out his long arms, grabbed
her bangs, and pulled out several hairs,
which he smelled, and then threw down
with an air of disgust.</p>

<p>Fannie was somewhat startled at first,
but, recovering herself, she said the monkey
must have thought her hair was wisps
of hay.</p>

<p>Miss Benton did not seem very fond of
the "monkey school," as they dubbed it
for the remainder of the afternoon, and
she proposed going to the pony track.
This gave general satisfaction. Here, too,
they found the uniformed children, all of
them having a lovely time. Miss Benton
found out, by conversing with one of the
attendants, that they were from one of
the city orphan asylums, and that the
whole lovely day was a gift to them from
one of its patrons&mdash;admission into the
garden and a ride for each child on one of
the ponies.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img class="plain" src="images/i63.jpg" width="713" height="432" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">Ralph was not in the least frightened.</p>
</div>

<p>They stood watching the orphan children
for awhile, as they rode around the
track, and Miss Benton asked if her guests
would not like a ride, too. Fannie, Winnie
and Miriam said that they would, and
each selected a pony; Fannie, who had
attended a riding-school, riding very
gracefully. Ralph thought he would like
a ride, too, so the riding-master brought
his smallest pony, and two of the little
<a class="pagenum" name="page_64" title="64"> </a>
orphan boys came up and begged permission
to lead it around the track.</p>

<p>Miss Benton consented, and, Ralph
having been lifted into the saddle, they
started off, a boy on each side of him.
But the little pony started to run, and one
of the boys was soon left behind; the
other, who had hold of the bridle, kept up
manfully for a time, but before the pony
had gone round the track, he, too, was left
behind. Ralph, however, held on to the
bridle himself, and, not in the least frightened,
kept his seat in the saddle as if it
had been his velocipede. And the by-standers
seemed to think it as cunning as
did his partial aunt and the rest of her
party. However, in spite of the courage
he had shown, Ralph was quite willing to
get off.</p>

<p>They remained at the track a little
longer, watching the other children riding,
and feeling glad that, if children
were left alone in the world, there were
people noble and good and with means
enough to gather the little waifs together,
and that they, too, had happy holidays.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<small>DREAMS AND REALITIES.</small></h2>


<div class="floatl">
  <img class="plain" src="images/i64.jpg" width="142" height="145" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap16">
<span class="smcaps"><span class="invisible">T</span>he</span>
following Friday
Gretta and Winnifred
were dismissed at recess,
the Friday afternoon
privilege of those
who had had perfect
marks for the week. As they passed
out through the yard together, Gretta
said:</p>

<p>"I'm going to church to practice my
organ lesson. Come go with me, Win."</p>

<p>Winnifred hesitated. "If I had
spoken to mamma about it this morning&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, let's go and ask her now."</p>

<p>"No, she won't be at home. She was
going out to Walnut Hills to make several
calls."</p>

<p>"Then I don't see what's to keep you
from going with me. No one will know
whether you are with me or at school."</p>

<p>Winnie knew very well that she had no
right to be away without anyone at home
knowing where she was, but she hesitated&mdash;and
was lost. The temptation was too
great; and beside, she reasoned, "What
difference can it possibly make whether I
am at school or at the church? If I had
not had good marks I couldn't have gone
home, anyway."</p>

<p>So the two girls passed on up the street
together. Winnifred soon forgot her
scruples, and laughed and chattered away
as usual. She had been reading Grimm's
story of the boy who could not understand
what it was to shiver. She had
thought it very amusing, and now she
narrated it at length to Gretta as they
went along, so that they reached the
church before Gretta had stopped laughing
at the absurd climax.</p>

<p>They went up the flight of steep stone
steps and tried the side door that led to
the choir gallery, but it was locked, and
<a class="pagenum" name="page_65" title="65"> </a>
Gretta said, "We'll have to go the back
way; come on, Win." So they descended
the stairs again and went through the
narrow side yard at the right of the
church.</p>

<p>At the back were two rooms which at
this time were occupied by the janitor and
his wife. Gretta knocked, and when the
door was opened by a smiling woman,
walked in with an I-have-a-right-to manner,
simply saying, "I've come to practice."
Winnifred followed somewhat
bashfully, but recovered her sense of being
herself when the door of the little living-room
closed upon them. The two girls
crossed a narrow passage and opened a
door leading to a stairway. It was very
dark here, but Gretta had traveled up and
down these stairs so many times that she
went swiftly now, while Winnifred, unaccustomed
to them, groped her way along
through the darkness very slowly.</p>

<p>When she reached the top Gretta
opened another door which led into the
church itself, always filled with people
when Winnifred had seen it before, but
now empty and mysterious, with the light
dimmed and deepened and transformed as
it made its way through the stained-glass
windows. She breathed a little heavily as
she glanced up at the pulpit on the left,
and almost felt as if she would hear a
voice rise from the empty air and chide
them for their boldness in entering so
sacred a place on workaday business. But
Gretta, entirely accustomed to independent
errands connected with musical matters,
passed on up the narrow side aisle,
Winnifred following slowly.</p>

<p>Then came another narrow staircase
leading to the choir gallery, which faced
the pulpit. When they reached the top
they found the shades all down and the
place quite dark except for a long, narrow
beam of light which streamed through a
crevice in one of the blinds. Winnifred
stopped on the threshold with something
like fear, which was yet pleasing because
of the sense of mystery and romance
which was blended with it in her imaginative
young mind. Gretta, however,
stepped in at once and went quickly toward
the back of the gallery. Here she
suddenly pulled up a shade, and Winnifred
saw numbers of music books piled up
on one of the long benches.</p>

<p>Gretta opened the organ and sat down.
She reached the pedals with some difficulty,
being obliged to stretch her legs
somewhat in order to do so; but this, like
everything else with her, was a part of the
musical education which was the chief
business of her life and of all the lives
nearest to her. She began to play a voluntary,
softly, slowly and reverently, yet
clearly, and with wonderful appreciation
for a child just entering her teens.</p>

<p>Winnifred climbed into the darkest
corner she could find and gave herself up
to enjoyment of the music and all the unusual
surroundings. Forgetting all else,
she began to weave herself and Gretta into
a little story of a world separate and apart
from the world she had always known: a
<a class="pagenum" name="page_66" title="66"> </a>
world filled with visionary forms and
faces, and in which there was no sound
but that of music.</p>

<p>"Over there in that pew just under the
stained-glass window," she thought, "is
a little girl who cannot see, but who has
never missed her eyesight, because she
does not need it. She lives only in this
world, where there is nothing but sweet
sounds. She will grow up some day and
go out into the other world where Gretta
and I lived yesterday, but she will be a
poet like Milton, whose picture, when he
was such a beautiful boy, I saw yesterday;
but she will not be sad like him, because
she knows only the world of poetry and
music.</p>

<p>"Over in that other pew," Winnie's
dreams ran on, "is that poor, little, blind
beggar girl I saw on the street yesterday
afternoon. She isn't hungry now, for
this is the fairyland of music where people
do not need to eat. The music has gone
straight to her heart&mdash;and see! she creeps
softly over to the opposite pew&mdash;how did
she know that the other little blind girl
was there?&mdash;she creeps softly to the
other pew, and they clasp hands and feel
as happy as if they had looked into each
other's eyes.</p>

<p>"And who is that sweet-faced girl in
the pew just in front of the pulpit? She
is beautiful. She looks like Nydia, the
blind girl in 'The Last Days of Pompeii,'
but she can't be Nydia, for Nydia lived
and died hundreds of years ago. But she
listens to the music just as Nydia might
do if she were here now. It is not so sad
to be blind in a world of music. And yet&mdash;how
would I know where they were
sitting if I were blind, too?"</p>

<p>And Winnie closed her eyes to try how
it would seem not to be able to see. The
music floated out upon the air; it grew
softer and softer and sounded farther and
farther away, and at last Winnie ceased to
hear it, for the darkness and the gentle
sounds had so soothed her senses that she
went straight from day-dreamland to
slumberland.</p>

<p>Gretta all unconsciously played on until
she had finished her allotted task, forgetting
the existence of Winnifred as completely
as the latter had forgotten hers.
But by and by she had finished the last
bar, and jumped up from her seat with a
feeling of satisfaction. She looked
around in surprise for a moment when
she realized that Winnifred had gone to
sleep. The next thing the latter knew
Gretta was shouting into her ear: "Wake
up! Wake up, Winnie! I'm all through
my practice and ready to go home. Let's
hurry! It must be late."</p>

<p>They gathered up their school books,
the sense of haste taking away all the feeling
of mystery and romance. When they
looked at the clock in the little room
downstairs on their way out, Winnifred
was dismayed and realized suddenly that
she ought to have been at home an hour
ago. She had a very uncomfortable walk
home, particularly after she had parted
from Gretta, but, as it happened, her
<a class="pagenum" name="page_67" title="67"> </a>
mother had not yet returned and her absence
had been unnoticed.</p>

<p>She told her mother about it in the
evening&mdash;of how sweetly Gretta had
played, and how she had imagined a
world made on purpose for blind people.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton only said, "I am glad you
had such a nice afternoon, dear. It is
one you will always remember. You were
fortunate that nothing happened to spoil
the pleasure of it. I am glad I was not
at home, however, for I fear I would have
been very uneasy about you."</p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<small>ARBOR DAY.</small></h2>


<div class="floatl">

</div>

<p class="dropcap16">
<span class="smcaps"><span class="invisible">In </span>nearly</span>
every household
of the big city the
children were astir
early, all wearing an
air of excitement, from
the six-year-old in the
primary school to the
"big brother" or sister in the intermediate,
for there was at last something new
under the sun&mdash;the celebration of
"Arbor Day" for the first time in their
city and State.</p>

<p>It was a day to be devoted to the trees
and their planting. Every school in the
city had had a plot of ground set aside for
its use, and every school had had at least
one tree planted, beside those in memory
of the teachers who had passed away to
the unknown land.</p>

<p>There was no set time for departure
and no special gathering place, so that at
almost any hour after nine o'clock on that
lovely May morning groups of children
might have been seen wending their way
toward the eastern hills. Those in the
vicinity of Eden Park walked, a few drove
over with their parents or friends, but the
great majority filled the street cars to
overflowing, laughing and chattering and
enjoying a holiday as only school children
can.</p>

<p>Forming a portion of the last class
were the pupils of the "First Intermediate,"
that old landmark which has
guided so many embryo citizens of our
great Republic through the intricate
paths of fractions, decimals, and so on, to
the crowning difficulty of cube root;
through grammar and history and geography,
before bidding them "Godspeed"
as they entered the high-school or took
up the story of their lives in some other
direction.</p>

<p>Among these last, lunch baskets in
hand, were the five young warriors, but
with their armor off and as great an air of
being on pleasure bent as though they had
never thought of anything more serious.
Miriam as usual had the floor, and the entire
car-load of girls and boys, nearly all
of them her classmates, were laughing at
her remarks.</p>

<p>There was a change of cars at Fountain
Square and again at the foot of the Mt.
Adams incline, but the five girls managed
to keep from being separated. Arrived
at the top of the hill, they stopped
<a class="pagenum" name="page_68" title="68"> </a>
to breathe in the fresh air and admire the
beautiful landscape&mdash;the Kentucky hills
far away in the distance, with the
beautiful Ohio flowing placidly at their
feet; Cincinnati, in its hill-encircled cup,
making, with Covington and Newport
and the various smaller villages, part of
one great whole, linked by the bridges
across the Ohio and the Licking.</p>

<p>"This reminds me," said Ernestine,
who was the historian of the little company,
"of the name first chosen for our
city&mdash;Losantiville, the town opposite the
mouth of the Licking; 'ville,' town;
'anti,' opposite; 'os,' mouth; 'L,' initial
of Licking."</p>

<p>"Dreadful!" said Miriam. "Imagine
this great city designated as a town across
the way from that little stream! It would
be like the immense woman I saw the
other day. I know she weighed over two
hundred. There was a little man walking
beside her, and he called her 'Birdie!'
Indeed he did, and she called him 'Horatio!'"</p>

<p>"Our city started about here," said
Ernestine, after the girls had stopped
laughing, "or just at the foot of the hill,
and grew first along the river. Later on
it spread northward, and Fourth Street
was one of its aristocratic streets."</p>

<p>"There comes Josie Thompson," said
Fannie. "She's evidently bent on having
a good time, and she's gotten up regardless.
See that chain around her neck;
plated, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"Don't look so sober, Ernestine," said
Miriam. "There wouldn't be any use
in living if you could not make fun of
people once in a while."</p>

<p>"But perhaps Josie has never been
taught any better at home," said Winnifred,
suddenly thinking of the giants.</p>

<p>"She has eyes, hasn't she?" said Gretta.
"But it seems to me she can't have ears,
or else she couldn't help hearing that
dress she has on. I know that's what my
father would say."</p>

<p>Just then Josie came up to them.
"Hello, girls! Going to have a good
time? I tell you I am! Glad to have
one day with no lessons to learn!" And
she passed on with her friends, leaving the
girls, even Ernestine, convulsed.</p>

<p>"Let's go on to the park," said Ernestine.</p>

<p>Accordingly they gathered up their
baskets and other belongings. It was but
a short walk, and they soon reached the
spot where many of their schoolmates
had already assembled.</p>

<p>At twelve o'clock the schools had a
few simple exercises. The children sang,
"My Country, 'Tis of Thee," one of the
girls of their grade recited "Woodman,
Spare that Tree," and Fannie's father
made a brief address. He talked to them
of the part the forests play in helping to
prevent drouths and disastrous floods. He
told of the old Italian poet who called
the trees "my brothers," and said that
everyone, whether poet or not, should
have especial tenderness and affection for
these beautiful and useful bits of nature
<a class="pagenum" name="page_69" title="69"> </a>
which grow up around us, relieving our
eyes from the glare of day, shading us
from the noonday sun, and giving us
pleasure in many ways, so that their useless
and wanton destruction becomes a sin
against mankind.</p>

<p>After the conclusion of this little talk
(for it was that rather than a set speech),
the children gathered up their lunch
baskets and boxes, each party sought the
spot that pleased it best, and soon the
hillside was dotted with groups of boys
and girls engaged in disposing of sandwiches,
pickles, pies, cakes, fruit, and so
on, with great enjoyment and good appetites.</p>

<p>The afternoon was passed most pleasantly
by Winnifred and her own special
friends, reinforced by many of the girls
and boys of her class. Games of all sorts
were indulged in with unflagging energy
and good spirits for two or three hours.</p>

<p>About four o'clock Fannie's parents
came for her in a carriage. Soon after
Winnifred's mother arrived on the scene
with little Ralph, and they were shown the
trees which had just been planted and told
about all the events of the day. By this
time nearly every one was making preparations
to leave, and by five o'clock the
park was almost deserted and the happy
day had become only a memory. But the
seeds of thought planted there fell not
altogether on stony ground, and were
destined to bear fruit at some future day.</p>

<p>Indeed, the very next morning Ralph
insisted on having an Arbor Day of his
own, and he put in the ground a branch
of willow, which took root and thrived,
growing so rapidly that in a few years it
was taller than himself; and each spring,
when it put forth its delicate gray-green
foliage, it recalled to Winnifred that most
delightful Arbor Day.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />

<small>GRETCHEN'S KAFFEEKLATCH.</small></h2>


<div class="floatl">
  <img class="plain" src="images/i69.jpg" width="154" height="197" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap16">
<span class="smcaps"><span class="invisible">A</span>nother</span>
year of
Gretta's life had
rolled around and
brought with it her
thirteenth birthday.
The little club of
"warriors" had not
been without its influence upon her behavior,
and she had become so ready to
enter upon her duties, so cheerful in performing
them, and so much less resentful
in accepting the reproof which was perhaps
too frequent in that busy and overworked
household, that her elder sister&mdash;whom
she had so complained of when the
subject of forming their club was first
mentioned&mdash;had decided that Gretta
must have a little birthday party, and
asked her whom she wished to invite.</p>

<p>Gretta was greatly delighted, for she
had long been wishing to have a meeting
of the club at her home, but had hardly
known how to broach the subject. She
immediately gave her sister the list, and
while the latter was somewhat surprised
<a class="pagenum" name="page_70" title="70"> </a>
that it should be so small, it was something
of a relief to find what she had
thought would be quite an undertaking so
greatly simplified. It was decided that
the girls should be invited to come at four
o'clock and that supper should be served
at half past five.</p>

<p>Promptly at the hour named Winnifred
and Miriam appeared, followed soon after
by Fannie, and then by Ernestine. The
door was opened by the smiling-faced,
German maid-of-all-work, and the girls
were met at the foot of the stairs by
Gretta, who took them up to the library
on the second floor. "Here we will have
no one to bother us," said Gretta. "My
mother is out of the city on a visit to my
uncle, and my sister has a music pupil in
the parlor, so we'll have the library all to
ourselves."</p>

<p>"How jolly!" said Miriam, looking
around. "Oh, here is a big reclining-chair!
We'll call it the president's chair,
and Winnifred shall occupy it, because she
was the first one to think of this club."</p>

<p>"Yes! yes!" they all insisted, so Winnifred
climbed into the big chair, and the
other girls ranged themselves in various
attitudes around her.</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Miriam, with a
half laugh and a half sigh, "I don't find
fighting such easy work as I thought I
would. I like to dress up my 'little observations,'
as my brother calls them, just
as much as I ever did, and I almost got
into a temper this morning because my
hair pulled when I began to comb it out."</p>

<p>"And I have been wishing we were
richer," said Ernestine, whose great ambition
it was to be contented with all that
came to her. "You know we had such
a hot spell last week, and mamma ought
to go away this summer. She is getting
thinner and thinner, and she has those
awful headaches more and more often
lately."</p>

<p>"I don't see why everybody can't have
the things they want," said Fannie, feeling
guilty to think she ever had a cross
minute.</p>

<p>"I said that to mamma last week," said
Ernestine, "when I felt uneasy about her,
and she said it all comes from something
in ourselves. That didn't make it any
easier for me; nothing did, until I
thought of the One who had not where to
lay His head. Then I felt ashamed."</p>

<p>For a minute the girls were silent. Then
Winnie said, "Well, I, for one, don't
think I have quite killed that ugly old
Hate. I can't bear to stop doing what I
like, to please other people. I was reading
'Grandfather's Chair' last night, and
I just hated to stop and tell Ralph his
story before he went to bed. You know
he always expects a story from some one
of us, and last night nobody had the time
but me."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what upsets me more than
anything else," said their little hostess;
"that is, to have to jump up from the
piano to answer the bell. And there's
never a day that I don't have to do it;
sometimes three or four times."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_71" title="71"> </a>
"What is your bugaboo, Fannie?" said
Miriam; "or don't you have any?"</p>

<p>"Don't I? I believe I have more than
any of you," was the answer. "But the
thing that grieves me most is that I can't
wear prettier and more expensive dresses
to school. You know, lots of the girls
who haven't half as much money as we
dress a great deal better. Mamma would
not care so much, but papa won't hear of
such a thing."</p>

<p>"What awful troubles we all do have!"
said Miriam, laughing.</p>

<p>"Miss Embry would say you shouldn't
use 'awful,'" said Winnie from the
depths of the big chair.</p>

<p>"There, you've hit it exactly!" said
Miriam. "There is my bugaboo in a nut
shell, and it really is an awful one. You
know I like to make things sound strong,
so I use all the strong-sounding words I
can find; and I suppose I do exaggerate.
Although I am reproved on all sides, it
hasn't the slightest effect on me, except
to make me wish that all the people who
reprove me, or remind me of someone who
does reprove,"&mdash;here she made big eyes
at Winnie&mdash;"were hard of hearing when
I am about. No, no; my motto is:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"'Tameness and slowness can't stay with me;</div>
      <div class="verse">They and I will never agree.'"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>"And yet," said Ernestine, "there are
a great many very interesting things told
in very simple language and without getting
away from the white truth."</p>

<p>"Well," said Miriam, "to tell the white
truth myself just this once. I don't know
whether I want to conquer this or not. I
don't believe it is really much relation to
the Giant Untruth. I think it's only a
little dwarfish imp, a Brownie, who
simply 'growed,' like Topsy, and to me is
just about as interesting."</p>

<p>"And yet even you couldn't call Topsy
beautiful," said Ernestine readily.</p>

<p>"Hardly," laughed Miriam. "But
now we've all owned up, let's parade rest,
as we say in our broom drills;" and she
threw herself back on the sofa, where she
sat as if indeed resting from a hard-fought
battle.</p>

<p>The five formed a group of American
girls good to look upon in their sweet
springtime. Ernestine, with serious gray
eyes, fair, slender, and tall for her fifteen
years, sat erect but graceful in a straight,
high-backed chair, her very pose denoting
a peaceful courage. Fannie, with skin
soft and rosy and eyes of a rare violet hue,
occupied a low seat, her arms resting on
the sofa against which she was leaning.
Miriam, with dark, sparkling eyes and
long, thick hair, looking brimful of life
in spite of her present lazy attitude, sat
just behind Fannie. Next came Winnie,
small even for her twelve years, brown-eyed
and dainty, looking fond of luxury,
as she undoubtedly was and always would
be, and yet good and high-minded. Last
Gretta herself, a true German, with blue
eyes and thick, light braids, a trim and
compact little maiden. She sat near a
table, her chin in her hand, with its flexible,
square-tipped fingers&mdash;the fingers
<a class="pagenum" name="page_72" title="72"> </a>
of the born and made pianist&mdash;for
Gretta had "begun," as her mates used
to tell, at the age of four.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant room in which they
sat; it had many books, German and
English and a few in other languages, and
where no book-cases rested, the walls
were hung with pictures of musicians&mdash;Mozart
and Bach and Mendelssohn and
many others as companions; and on a
pedestal stood a bust of Beethoven, whom&mdash;so
Gretta told the girls as they looked
around&mdash;her father considered the greatest
of them all.</p>

<p>Just then Winnie glanced up at the
clock and saw that it was fifteen minutes
past five. She made a motion to the
girls, at which they all jumped up, and,
joining hands, formed a circle around
Gretta. Before she had had time to do
anything but look astonished, Miriam
stopped behind her, and, holding something
over her head, said, "Heavy, heavy
hangs over your head. What shall the
owner do to redeem it?"</p>

<p>Before Gretta had a chance to answer,
Miriam had dropped into her lap a box
of pretty note-paper, and replied to her
own question by saying, "The owner shall
redeem it by writing to the giver this
summer a letter for each week they are
separated."</p>

<p>Then the girls circled about again, and
this time Winnifred stopped behind
Gretta, saying:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Open your mouth and shut your eyes,</div>
      <div class="verse">And I'll give you something to make you wise."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Gretta did as she was bidden, and Winnie
popped a big marshmallow into her
mouth, depositing the remainder of the
box in her lap.</p>

<p>They circled about her for the third
time, and Fannie stopped behind her, saying,
as Miriam had done, "Heavy, heavy
hangs over your head. What shall the
owner do to redeem it?" and continued,
"Read every word of it and enjoy it," and
placed in Gretta's hand a copy of "Little
Lord Fauntleroy."</p>

<p>Yet again they circled about her, singing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"A rosy wreath I twine for thee,</div>
      <div class="verse">Of Flora's richest treasures;</div>
      <div class="verse">Take, oh, take, this rosy, rosy crown,</div>
      <div class="verse">Flora's richest treasures,</div>
      <div class="verse">Flora's richest treasures,"&mdash;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>and Ernestine placed a crown of flowers
on Gretta's brow.</p>

<p>Gretta was quite overcome with pleasure
and surprise, for the girls had so
skillfully hidden their little gifts that
she had not even caught a glimpse of
them.</p>

<p>Just then the door opened, and the
hostess' sister appeared at the door, saying,
"Tea is ready, Gretta." Before they
did anything else, however, Gretta had to
exhibit her presents. They were duly admired,
and then Miss Josephine said,
"Come on, now; I'll head the procession.
Keep step."</p>

<p>Through the open door came the sound
of a lively march, which even Gretta had
never heard before.</p>

<p>"That is a new march which father
<a class="pagenum" name="page_73" title="73"> </a>
composed in honor of your birthday. He
calls it 'Gretchen's March.'"</p>

<div class="center">
  <img class="plain" src="images/i73.jpg" width="510" height="628" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">Winnifred popped a big marshmallow into her mouth.&mdash;See page 72.</p>
</div>

<p>They all felt very important as they
marched down the stairs, headed by Miss
Berger, who led
them out into the
long parlor and twice
around it, while her
father at the piano,
with a merry twinkle
in his eyes, kept on
playing, and then
out into the dining-room.</p>

<p>The table was set
for five only, and the
girls, directed by
Miss Josephine, took
their seats, with
Gretta at the head,
to the inspiring
strains of the lively
march.</p>

<p>It proved a most
enjoyable little feast.
Miss Berger left the
room as soon as they
were all seated, and
then the same smiling-faced
maid who
had opened the door
for them, also departed, and gave them
an opportunity to look about.</p>

<p>At Gretta's place was a set of cunning
china cups and saucers, which had been
sent her from Germany when she was
quite a little child. The cups were just
about the size of after-dinner coffees, and
the smiling Mina had insisted on calling
the little party "Gretchen's Kaffeeklatch."
Miss Berger had been so amused
that she fell in with the idea, and had decided
that they really should have coffee
and some of Mina's coffee-cake on the bill
of fare.</p>

<p>As Gretta filled the little cups, and the
coffee and its delicious adjunct were
<a class="pagenum" name="page_74" title="74"> </a>
passed around, five tongues chattered as
fast as those of their elders might have
done on a similar occasion.</p>

<p>When the coffee-cake and sandwiches
and chicken salad had been disposed of,
Gretta touched the bell at her place, and
Mina appeared. After clearing the table,
she brought in a great cake with thirteen
little candles on it burning away merrily,
and a great bowl of lemonade. Miss Josephine
came in and cut the cake and
served the lemonade, and was as entertaining
and companionable as any of them
could have desired.</p>

<p>They sat at the table a long time, then
they went into the parlor and were introduced
to Gretta's father. They shook
hands with him timidly, for they had been
so impressed by his strictness with Gretta
in regard to her musical studies that they
were a little afraid of him. Though they
felt vaguely conscious that he was looking
at them quizzically, he threw off the yoke
of business entirely and entered into their
games like a boy.</p>

<p>Among the other enjoyable things
they played "Magic Music." It was
really the game of "Hunt the Slipper,"
and when the music was soft they were
"cold," and when it was loud they were
"hot." Mr. Berger played for them, and
never before had these girls played this
game to such music.</p>

<p>The four girls walked home together in
the Late twilight, declaring to each other
that they had never had such a delightful
time; and Fannie, who had once spoken
so contemptuously of Gretta as a "music
teacher's daughter," was loudest in her
praise.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />

<small>THE BOAT-RIDE.</small></h2>


<div class="floatl">
  <img class="plain" src="images/i74.jpg" width="134" height="214" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap16">
<span class="smcaps"><span class="invisible">A </span>few</span>
evenings after the
meeting at Gretta's,
Uncle Fred came in, and,
pulling Winnie's ears according
to his custom,
said:</p>

<p>"I think it's my turn
to treat, Winnifred; at
least Kitty says it is. She and I were out
boating yesterday, and she suggests that I
take you and the other Joans for a row
Friday evening."</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Fred," cried Winnie, "that
will be grand! I'll tell the girls about it
to-morrow. Who all are to be invited?"</p>

<p>"'You-all,' as our Southern friends
say, and your Aunt Kitty; us seven, and
no more, as the poet expresses it."</p>

<p>The girls accepted with eagerness. But
on Thursday Ernestine did not come to
school. Winnie went around Friday noon
to learn the reason of such an unusual
occurrence, and found that Mrs. Alroy
was sick in bed, and although she had protested
against her daughter's staying at
home, Ernestine could not be prevailed
upon to leave her.</p>

<p>The other girls were, of course, very
sorry not to have her go, but soon forgot
their disappointment in the excitement
<a class="pagenum" name="page_75" title="75"> </a>
of anticipation. At a quarter past six,
the hour agreed upon, Fannie was ringing
Mrs. Burton's door bell, while Gretta and
Miriam were just entering the gate. Winnie
and her uncle and aunt were quite
ready, so they all started out. After a
short ride in the "Green Line," they were
transferred to the Covington and Newport
cars on their way to the river. None
of the girls had been in that neighborhood
often enough to be familiar with it, and
everything they saw had the interest of
novelty for them. When they reached the
bridge, Mr. Fred helped them out of the
car and they went on down the bank of
the river. They stood there for awhile
watching the many boats, large and small,
the people going and coming, none of
whom seemed to be in the same hurry
as those farther up in the city, and most
of whom were men sauntering leisurely
along with their hands in their pockets.</p>

<p>Mr. Fred, who had left the girls for a
few minutes, now came back, and, on his
giving the command, they followed him
to a pretty little dock where there were
several row-boats. In one of these the
five girls were soon seated, Winnie in the
bow, Gretta and Fannie in the stern,
while Miriam and Miss Kitty&mdash;who
could both row&mdash;sat together where each
could handle an oar, declaring that they
meant to help provide some of the power.
Uncle Fred took his place in the seat of
"the crack oarsman," as he said, the
smiling boatman on the wharf pushed
them off, and soon they found themselves
afloat. Fannie held the rudder and
handled it very skillfully, although Mr.
Fred kept a sharp lookout himself, for the
river at this point was full of craft of all
descriptions, from the large steamboats
whose journey continues through the
beautiful Ohio down through "The
Father of Waters;" the ferry boats crossing
between Ohio and Kentucky; little
steam launches and row-boats, just starting
out for pleasure; and fishing-boats returning
laden from the day's work.</p>

<p>At first Miss Kitty and Miriam splashed
about a little, but soon they became accustomed
to each other and pulled such a
steady, even stroke that Mr. Fred was
obliged to stop laughing at them, and
even acknowledged that they were helping
to make the boat go.</p>

<p>All along the shores of the river were
numbers of shanty boats, and as they approached
the mouth of the Licking they
saw more of these. Winnie, especially,
was much interested in them, and enjoyed
her seat in the bow as giving a good opportunity
to catch a glimpse of some of
their inmates&mdash;little boys with bare feet,
girls with bright-colored dresses, many
barking dogs, and an occasional cat, all of
whom, in her eyes, were invested with a
peculiar fascination.</p>

<p>But soon they entered the mouth of the
Licking, and, gradually leaving all these
sights and sounds behind them, passed
into an enchanted country, the domain of
Nature herself. Miss Kitty started up
softly, "My country, 'tis of thee," and the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_76" title="76"> </a>
girls joined in, Miriam's contralto adding
richness to the voices as they rose and
fell on the still air. Miss Kitty and Miriam
had already drawn their oars up into
the boat, and Mr. Fred let his trail idly
in the water as he listened.</p>

<p>When they had finished the last stanza,
Winnie said, "Aunt Kitty, won't you and
Uncle Fred sing 'Juanita' for us? The
moon is just rising behind those trees,
and this is the very time for that duet."</p>

<p>"What a romantic little thing it is!"
said Fred, teasingly; but he joined his sister
in the pretty duet, which has been
sung on the water so many times as almost
to be considered a boating song. After
this they took to their oars again, and,
pulling hard against the stream, advanced
silently but rapidly.</p>

<p>Presently Mr. Fred, with a strong pull
on his left oar, turned the boat, in spite
of Fannie's hold on the rudder, and it
shot suddenly in toward the right bank,
where was a little beach in a sheltered
cove under an immense willow tree. Here
Mr. Fred jumped out, and, after making
the boat fast to the tree, assisted the other
members of the party to disembark.</p>

<p>"Follow me!" he commanded, starting
up the bank, which here sloped gradually
to the water's edge.</p>

<p>The little company soon reached the
top of the bank. The moon, nearly full,
had just risen, and by its light, struggling
with that of the dying day, they saw a
little path leading up the green hillside.
Along this they went, single file, wondering
where Mr. Fred and Miss Kitty were
taking them, when suddenly they were
startled by the bark of a dog, and in a
second a great mastiff jumped up almost
to Mr. Fred's shoulders, and nearly
knocked him down by the force of the
spring.</p>

<p>Winnie was struck dumb with fear, and
the other girls screamed, but Mr. Fred
said, in a tone which quite reassured
them:</p>

<p>"Down, down, Jasper! Don't let your
joy make you forget your manners."</p>

<p>Jasper wagged his tail as if to say, "All
right, sir," and trotted along the path,
with Mr. Fred's hand on his head.</p>

<p>The path wound about through the
trees, and when they reached the top of
the hill they saw a large white house,
and coming towards them a tall young
man, who called out cheerily:</p>

<p>"We've been looking for you for the
last half hour. Come right along. Nellie
and Rob can hardly contain themselves,
they have been so afraid you wouldn't
come."</p>

<p>He led the way around the house, and
soon had ushered the new-comers into a
large, square parlor with long windows
opening on a broad veranda.</p>

<p>"Nellie, Rob," he said, "here are the
'Warrior Maidens,' of whom you have
heard so much."</p>

<p>The two children, Nellie about fourteen,
and Rob a few years younger, bowed
bashfully, and then looked appealingly at
their elder brother, as they sat down on
<a class="pagenum" name="page_77" title="77"> </a>
the two chairs farthest removed from
those occupied by their guests. The moon
was now above the tree tops, and shone
into the room brightly through the long
windows.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="images/i77.jpg" width="687" height="544" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">They passed unto an enchanted country.&mdash;See page 75.</p>
</div>

<p>"A glorious night for a game of hide-and-seek,"
said the older brother suggestively,
in answer to an unspoken appeal
of the younger ones.</p>

<p>"And this would be a grand place for
it," said Miss Kitty. "I used to think
a game of I-spy on a moonlight night the
finest thing in the world. Suppose we
try it now?"</p>

<p>"Yes! yes!" they all exclaimed; and,
headed by their young hosts, rushed out
of doors, and for half an hour made the
hills echo with their shouts of merriment.</p>

<p>Such places as there were in which to
hide!&mdash;a dark corner in the grape arbor,
a nook in the vine-covered summer-house,
a deep-shadowed projection from the
stable or house or veranda: such chances
to "make home" around the house, which
<a class="pagenum" name="page_78" title="78"> </a>
stood in the center of the yard! Miss
Kitty generally came in first, but once,
after long searching, she was found in the
hollow of a tree into which she had
crawled, and from which, being caught in
her own trap, she had to be pulled out by
the united efforts of her brother and
niece.</p>

<p>Then Miss Kitty declared that it was
high time they should start for home.
But when they went into the house to get
their wraps, they found the smiling
mother of their hosts waiting for them
with a great bowl of strawberries, picked,
she said, just before the sun went down,
and which they must really try. It was
not a difficult task to persuade the guests
to do this, and after they had all done full
justice to the berries and the accompanying
cake and rich, sweet milk, they set
forth to embark for home, escorted to the
river by the entire family of their new
friends.</p>

<p>The row home was enjoyed even more,
if that were possible, than the one
thither. The moon was now high in the
sky, and hill and tree and rock and
dimpling wave were beautified by its enchanting
glamour.</p>

<p>They all felt either too tired, or too
happy, or both perhaps, to talk, and the
trip was made almost in silence, although
Miss Kitty stopped rowing once, and
quoted softly:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<small>SAD NEWS.</small></h2>


<div class="floatl">

</div>

<p class="dropcap27">
<span class="smcaps"><span class="invisible">The </span>next</span>
morning
Winnie wakened
early and lay for
some time thinking
over the pleasure
of the evening
before and the
events of the past
six months. It seemed to her as if a long
time had elapsed since the evening on
which she began to look upon life as something
of a battle-field. She felt older,
and yet light-hearted, as the gentle air of
late May, stealing in through the open
window, lightly stirred the thin curtains
and brushed her face "like the breeze
from an angel's wing," she thought.</p>

<p>"How happy we all have been!" she
said aloud. "And Ernestine&mdash;I wish
she had been with us last night&mdash;is the
happiest of all, because she is the best."</p>

<p>Then she dozed off again, and did not
awake until she heard little Ralph calling
at her door: "Hurry up, 'Innie!
B'eakast is 'most weady!"</p>

<p>She sprang out of bed in haste then,
and was in the dining-room in time to
take her seat with the rest.</p>

<p>"'He maketh the storm a calm, and
the waves thereof are still,'" she quoted
when it came her turn to give her selection.
She had chosen this one for its
gentle beauty.</p>

<p>How pleasant it all was! How full of
<a class="pagenum" name="page_79" title="79"> </a>
life and joy everything seemed, even to
the carnations in the center of the table,
with their spicy odor!</p>

<p>She performed her Saturday morning
duties cheerfully, and after lunch asked
permission to take her books and go to
Ernestine's to look over the lessons for
Monday, for the end of the year&mdash;their
last year in the Intermediate&mdash;was rapidly
approaching, and, their course being
almost completed, they would soon begin
the heavy review in preparation for the
high-school examination.</p>

<p>Permission was readily granted, and
Winnifred started off with a light heart.
When she reached Ernestine's home, a
gentleman came down the steps and
passed out of the door just as she was
about to enter the hall, so, somewhat surprised,
she went up the stairs more slowly
than usual and knocked softly. It was
opened by a strange lady, who, in answer
to Winnifred's inquiry for Ernestine,
said: "Ernestine is with her mother,
who is so ill that the doctor says she must
either have a trained nurse or go to the
hospital."</p>

<p>"Oh, I must go right home and tell
mamma!" said Winnie, and she went away
without another word.</p>

<p>When she reached home, she found her
mother in the sitting-room doing the
week's mending. On hearing her daughter's
sad news she hurriedly changed her
dress and set out at once for Mrs. Alroy's.</p>

<p>She was gone an hour&mdash;an age, it
seemed to Winnifred, unsuccessfully
struggling to keep her mind on her lessons.
When Mrs. Burton returned, her
face was very grave, and she drew Winnie
toward her with a warm embrace as she
said:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Alroy has decided to have a
nurse; she says she has saved a little
money for just such an emergency and
prefers to be at home where she can have
Ernestine with her. She asked me to
send for Mr. Allen."</p>

<p>"Fannie's father?" said Winnifred,
surprised.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I want you to go there now
and leave a note for him." And seating
herself at her desk, Mrs. Burton wrote a
short note while Winnie was getting on
her hat.</p>

<p>Winnie felt very sober&mdash;and, it must
be confessed, also somewhat important&mdash;as
she hurried away to deliver the note.
She found Mr. Allen at home, and, having
sent up the note by the servant who
answered the bell, she asked for Fannie,
for she longed to talk the matter over
with one of her mates. But Fannie, from
her room at the head of the stairs, had
heard Winnifred's voice, and now came
running down to meet her.</p>

<p>"What is it, Win?" she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, Fannie," was the reply, "I'm
afraid something awful is going to happen
at Ernestine's house! Her mother is
very, very sick. I went there this morning
just as the doctor was coming away,
and he said she must either go to the hospital
or have a trained nurse. Mamma
<a class="pagenum" name="page_80" title="80"> </a>
went over right away, and now Mrs. Alroy
has sent for your father."</p>

<p>"For papa! Isn't that strange? Come
up to my room, Winnie, and stay awhile,
can't you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Winnie, hesitatingly.
"Mamma didn't say for me to
hurry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, come on then," said Fannie,
leading the way up the softly carpeted
stairs.</p>

<p>Winnie followed with scarcely a glance
around. Although Fannie's father was
much wealthier than her own, and his
house finer in every way, her heart was
too full for much interest in fine ornamentation;
and besides, child though she
was, she instinctively felt that culture and
true refinement are at home anywhere.</p>

<p>But it was the first time she had ever
been in Fannie's own room, and this she
found interesting in spite of the emotions
which had troubled her heart during the
day. It certainly was a charming nook,
with its pink-curtained bed half hidden
behind a large four-fold screen with the
Seasons painted in oil upon its panels; the
pretty white dressing-table, draped to
match the bed, and filled with the dainty
accessories of a girl's toilet; a low, well-filled
book case and desk combined; the
pretty matting and rugs; and the many
pictures and other ornaments here and
there.</p>

<p>The girls sat down on a little willow
seat, large enough for two, and Winnie
had to begin all over again and tell what
she knew about Mrs. Alroy's illness. In
the meantime they heard Mr. Allen descend
the stairs and go out of the street
door before Fannie had time to call to
him.</p>

<p>"I wonder if papa has gone to Mrs. Alroy's
now," said she. "Whatever can she
want of him? Perhaps she is going to
have him make her will."</p>

<p>"But why should she do that?" said
Winnie. "She can't have much to leave
to anybody; and, if she had, Ernestine
would be the only one to get it, wouldn't
she? But what would Ernestine do if her
mother should die? Who would take
care of her? You know she has always
said she would teach when she had finished
school, and it will be years before
she does that. Do you know, if the worst
should happen, I'd love to have her stay
with us, and I almost believe mamma
would be willing."</p>

<p>"I think that would be a good deal for
your family to do," was the answer, "but
maybe papa would help."</p>

<p>"I don't believe Ernestine would be
helped by anyone unless she did something
in return. But how long I am staying!
I must go right away."</p>

<p>"Oh, stay just a minute longer," said
Fannie. "I want to show you my hanging
garden;" and she threw up the long
window and stepped out to a little balcony,
almost filled with flowers in pots
and boxes, and baskets full of vines
drooping over all.</p>

<p>"Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed Winnie.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_81" title="81"> </a>
"Yes, isn't it? I care more for this
than anything else I have," Fannie replied,
breaking off a bunch of heliotrope
and pinning it to her friend's dress.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you!" said Winnie. "But
now I must go."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose you must," said Fannie,
reluctantly. "I'll put on my hat and
go a ways with you."</p>

<p>They went down the stairs and out into
the street together, talking alternately&mdash;as
people do under such circumstances&mdash;of
trivial things and of that which filled
their hearts.</p>

<p>When Winnifred reached home, she
found her mother seated at the open window
of the sitting-room, darning a pair
of stockings&mdash;a homely enough occupation,
but to Winnie's eyes her mother had
never looked so dear or so beautiful, and
she went and put her arms about her neck.
Her mother returned the embrace, holding
her close for a moment, and then she
said gently:</p>

<p>"Have you your lessons for Monday,
dear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma," said Winnie, "it does
not seem to me as if I can ever study
again!"</p>

<p>"Is there any nearer duty, Winnie?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;I suppose not. But,
mamma, I can't put my mind on my lessons,
when Ernestine's mother is so sick."</p>

<p>"Can you help Ernestine any by
neglecting your own duties, dear? You
do not recognize Giant Despair when he
comes in the guise of love and sympathy
for your friends, but he it is who comes
at these times. You know in Whose
hands are the issues of life and death, of
health and sickness. You cannot help
Ernestine's future by worrying over her
present; but you may mar a portion of
your own by neglecting your present."</p>

<p>Winnie could not help knowing that
her mother was right. She took out her
books, and was soon so hard at work that
her disturbed emotions were quieted, and
by supper time, though still full of sympathy
for her friend, she was quite herself
again, and ready to play the accompaniment
to the new piece her brother was
learning. And when she went to bed, it
was to sleep peacefully, rather than to lie
awake fighting unseen terrors, as Mrs.
Burton well knew would have been the
case with her high-strung child had she
been allowed to brood over the events of
the day.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<small>THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW.</small></h2>


<div class="floatl">
  <img class="plain" src="images/i81.jpg" width="152" height="215" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap16">
<span class="smcaps"><span class="invisible">T</span>he</span>
next day at breakfast
Mrs. Burton announced
her intention
of going to see Mrs.
Alroy instead of attending
church, and
said that if she were
not home to dinner
they might know she
had thought it necessary to remain.</p>

<p>"Mayn't I go with you, mamma?"
asked Winnifred.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_82" title="82"> </a>
"I think it would not be best for either
Ernestine or yourself, Winnie, and certainly
not for Mrs. Alroy."</p>

<p>Winnie at once saw that her mother was
right, and instead of demurring, she went
and gathered some beautiful clusters of
lilacs for Ernestine, and cut the one white
rose in bloom on her window-sill to send
to Mrs. Alroy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton set off, taking a basket of
fruit and the flowers, but she sighed as
she turned the corner leading to Mrs. Alroy's,
for she felt that the fruit would
never refresh the world-weary woman for
whom it was intended.</p>

<p>When she reached her destination she
glanced apprehensively up to the second-story
windows, for, although she said
nothing about it to Winnie, she had on
the previous day given up all hope of Mrs.
Alroy's recovery. But the sorrowful banner
which she had dreaded to see was not
there, and she breathed more freely as she
passed up the stairs.</p>

<p>In answer to her low knock the door
was opened by Ernestine, who smiled as
Mrs. Burton took her hand, a sad little
smile of welcome which went to her visitor's
heart.</p>

<p>"Mamma is resting quite easily now,
but she passed a painful night. I will
tell the nurse you are here. How beautiful
the flowers and fruit are!" she said,
as Mrs. Burton handed the basket to her.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; the lilacs are for you&mdash;you
know their odor is too strong for a
sick-room&mdash;but Winnie sent this rose
from her own little monthly to your
mother."</p>

<p>Ernestine's lips quivered, as she took
the rose without speaking, and went into
the little bedroom, closing the door gently
behind her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton found a vase, which she
filled with water to put the lilacs in, and
sat down to await the nurse's coming. She
had not long to wait. The nurse, entering,
closed the door behind her as softly
as Ernestine had done, and motioned Mrs.
Burton to follow her into the little
kitchen.</p>

<p>"There is not the slightest hope," said
she, in answer to Mrs. Burton's anxious
inquiry. "The doctor says it may be a
matter of hours only, although she may
live for some days yet. It is neuralgia of
the heart and she has been suffering exceedingly.
However, she is resting easier
now&mdash;which is not a good sign, you
know&mdash;and wants to see you. She has
asked me to send her daughter on some
little errand, because she wants to see you
alone."</p>

<p>They entered Mrs. Alroy's room together,
and Ernestine, at a sign from the
nurse, followed her out of the room. Mrs.
Alroy took Mrs. Burton's outstretched
hand, and for a moment neither spoke.
Then the former said quietly:</p>

<p>"Please sit down, Mrs. Burton, for I
have much to say to you. And I cannot
speak long at a time, so you will have to
be patient with me. You are not in a
hurry?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_83" title="83"> </a>
"My dear Mrs. Alroy, I have the day
at your disposal. Do not hesitate to
command me."</p>

<p>"You know something of my past life&mdash;so
I found out yesterday. I need not
touch upon it further. It is past now and
I no longer regret it. But it is of the
future I wish to speak. Not my own&mdash;that
lies beyond our knowing&mdash;but of
my daughter's&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sick woman put her hand over her
eyes a moment, and Mrs. Burton walked
to the window to fight back the tears
which were fast rising to her eyes. Mrs.
Alroy was the first to regain control of
herself, and as Mrs. Burton resumed her
seat, she went on:</p>

<p>"I had a long talk with Mr. Allen yesterday.
He knows my family and I have
placed my affairs in his hands. I have
no doubt that Ernestine will be taken care
of, but it is of her immediate future that
I wish to speak. I would not have her go
among strangers at once, and I am about
to ask a great favor of you. The child
loves you next to myself; your daughter is
her dearest friend&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Winnifred feels it an honor to be
thought so. Nothing would please both
of us, all of us, better than to have Ernestine
make her home with us for as long a
time as she may desire."</p>

<p>"You give me courage to die. You
could almost give me courage to live&mdash;but
not quite. Yes, that is what I wish
to ask of you, but only for the remainder
of the school year. Preparing for the
high-school examination will occupy my
little girl's mind and help her to bear the
separation, and after that&mdash;in the shadow
of death pride vanishes, and I have requested
Mr. Allen to write to my brother.
They will settle everything else." She
sank back on her pillows and closed her
eyes wearily.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton could not immediately
command her voice, but laid her hand
gently on that of the sick woman. The
latter, without opening her eyes, continued:</p>

<p>"I shall not last long; this pain has
too constantly been hovering about my
heart; it cannot be driven back again; it
must soon strike its last blow. But I do
not fear it; it will be sharp but quick.
Nor do I wish to live. Even my little
daughter's wonderful love for me can no
longer hold me. Besides, I know that
from a material point of view she will
only profit by my departure. She does
not know that, and I am all she has&mdash;and
I have not had the courage to tell
her. This hard task I must ask you to do
for me. I have only a hope&mdash;to you that
hope is certainty. Your views are different;
you can soften the blow as I cannot
do. You will stay here awhile?"</p>

<p>"Anything I can do for you is too little."</p>

<p>"I have been loquacious, but I had long
restrained myself. What time is it?"</p>

<p>"Half past eleven."</p>

<p>"Ernestine will soon be here, and I will
tell her to make a cup of tea for you."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_84" title="84"> </a>
"Oh, no&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, it will give her occupation and
relieve the strain. There she is now."</p>

<p>Ernestine came in with soft footsteps.
"How do you feel now, mamma?" she
asked gently.</p>

<p>"Quite easy, dear. I think I shall
sleep for a little while. Mrs. Burton will
stay to lunch, and you may make a cup
of tea for her and yourself. The nurse
will stay with me now; you can call
her."</p>

<p>The nurse came, and Mrs. Burton and
Ernestine left the room together.</p>

<p>After the sad little lunch Mrs. Burton,
summoning up all her courage, spoke.</p>

<p>"Ernestine," she said, "your mother
has asked me to tell you something which
she would gladly spare you knowledge of,
but which you must know. She is going
on a long journey, from which she can no
more return to you. But you will one
day go to her."</p>

<p>Ernestine's great eyes dilated wildly.
"You mean that my mother is going&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear, my dear! Your mother
walks in the valley of the shadow of death,
yet she fears no evil. You&mdash;and I and
all who love you and her&mdash;are enveloped
in its gloom, but if she fears not
passing to the Unknown, shall we fear for
her or for ourselves?"</p>

<p>"I cannot do without my mother, Mrs.
Burton! I cannot! I cannot! She is
all I have&mdash;all I want!" and the girl
burst into a tempest of tears.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton gathered her up in her
arms and let her weep undisturbed for
some minutes. Then she said gently:</p>

<p>"Your mother wants to go. If she
could live longer, she would seldom be
free from pain. Besides, it is God's will."</p>

<p>"Oh, my mother! my mother!" And
Ernestine dropped upon her knees.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton went out and left her,
knowing that the stricken child's hope
was in a Comforter greater than herself.</p>

<p>When Ernestine went in later, pale but
quiet, her mother turned toward her with
a smile.</p>

<p>"Kiss me, my daughter, my baby!" she
said, "and be at peace, as I am."</p>

<p>The windows of the little bedroom
faced the west, and toward evening Mrs.
Alroy asked the nurse to draw back the
curtains. "It has been a stormy day,"
she said, "but the sun is setting clear. I
think I will go to sleep."</p>

<p>And she closed her tired eyes, and "fell
on sleep" without being touched by the
dreaded pain.</p>

<p>When they knew that it was indeed all
over, they led Ernestine away, and she
allowed them to put on her hat and went
submissively home with Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>When she returned to her own home
again, the little room had been transformed
into a bower of flowers, and Mrs.
Alroy slept under their fragrant covering,
beautiful and serene, with a smile on her
lips. Ernestine was met on the threshold
by a tall, handsome man, who put his
arms about her and said how glad he was
to see his little niece. He had come at
<a class="pagenum" name="page_85" title="85"> </a>
once in response to Mr. Allen's telegram.</p>

<p>All was quiet and beautiful. A dozen
or so friends gathered to listen to the
sweet words of farewell to the dead and
of benediction to the living; and then Mr.
Van Orten took his sister home with him,
that she might lie beside her kindred in
the little old village on the banks of the
Hudson.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />

<small>A BUSY MONTH.</small></h2>


<div class="floatl">
  <img class="plain" src="images/i85.jpg" width="160" height="254" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap16">
<span class="smcaps"><span class="invisible">M</span>r. van Orten</span>
left
his niece behind him
reluctantly, but Mr.
Allen had convinced
him that his sister
had decided wisely,
and that nothing
could be better for
Ernestine during
the coming month
than the calm and cheerful atmosphere of
Mrs. Burton's home. Ernestine's own
cot had been brought and placed in Winnie's
room, and the two girls were tucked
in every night by the same motherly
hands. Little Ralph took Ernestine at
once into his affections, made her smile at
his quaint fancies and cunning little
tongue, and his father and brother treated
her as if she had always been one of them.</p>

<p>The end of the school year was rapidly
approaching, and there was a great deal
of work to be done. Ernestine and Winnie
were both anxious to do honor to their
school and to the teachers who had
worked with them hard and patiently, so
every minute was occupied in some way,
and Ernestine had no time for unhealthy
grieving.</p>

<p>On Saturday afternoons Fannie and
Miriam and Gretta came to Mrs. Burton's,
and they all went over the week's work
together. Sometimes Mr. Allen and Fannie
came and took Winnifred and Ernestine
for a drive through the beautiful
suburbs, and one evening they had another
row on the river with Uncle Fred
and Aunt Kitty.</p>

<p>And so the weeks wore away and
brought the bright June day when they
all walked together to the high-school to
take their examination seats. Their
hearts beat high with hope and courage,
and swelled with self-importance not altogether
to be made light of; for it had been
their aim for many months to gain this
last fight of their school year on the very
field on which they would plant their banners
of occupation if they won. And win
they felt sure they would, for this was but
the supreme test to prove the force and
earnestness of what had gone before.</p>

<p>"On, on to victory!" laughed Miriam
each morning, waving her hands high
above her head. And "On, on to victory!"
laughed the four other girls, echoing
her cry.</p>

<p>How they worked that week, their
young heads bent over their papers, while
their young eyes carefully perused those
<a class="pagenum" name="page_86" title="86"> </a>
wonderful "printed questions"! The
five, so different in manner, but so alike
in aim and purpose&mdash;Ernestine, calm,
deliberate, direct; Fannie, thoughtful but
rapid; Gretta, neat, painstaking, and a little
anxious; Miriam, dashing ahead impulsively,
scratching out a word here or inserting
one there, doing twice to thinking
once, but thinking that once well; and
Winnie, absorbed, thorough and confident&mdash;were
noted with interest by the
stranger teachers watching them, for they
had learned to work with a definite aim
which showed itself in their very attitudes.</p>

<p>They took the questions home with
them, and each day the five might be seen
at the home of one or the other, again
going over the work, replying one at a
time and sometimes all at once to the oft-repeated
query, "How did you answer
this?" or "Did you prove that?"</p>

<p>Sometimes the group was joined by one
or more of their other classmates, and
once Josie Thompson, wearing her brightest
dress and biggest pin, called to them as
she passed: "Isn't this a horrid old examination?
I know I won't pass, and I
don't care if I don't. My mother says if
I fail she'll take me out of school, and I'll
be glad of it. I can't see any fun in digging
every minute, and what's the use of
all this high-school stuff anyhow! I can
have a better time without it."</p>

<p>And on the last day she waved her
hands to them across the street and
shouted: "Good-by, girls! I know it's
all up with me!"</p>

<p>"Poor Josie!" said Ernestine, after they
had gone home; "trying so hard to have
a good time, and missing it after all."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Burton, laying her
hand gently on the girl's head, "like the
dog in the fable, she is losing the substance
to grasp at the shadow."</p>

<p>"Tell me about the dog in the table,
Ernie," said Ralph, pulling at Ernestine's
dress to attract her attention.</p>

<p>"I don't think I know, you little dear!"
she said, laughing gently at his mistake.
"We must ask your mamma to tell us
both."</p>

<p>"Then 'Innie must hear, too!" said the
child, running to the door to call his
sister.</p>

<p>It was what Miriam called a "delicious"
evening, and after tea she and
Fannie and Gretta came strolling over to
talk about the events of the week and
reassure each other that "all was well."
Ralph looked upon each of them as his
own particular friend and in a sense his
charge, and so he now proceeded to enlighten
them on the subject of the dog in
the fable as follows:</p>

<p>"There was a dog and a table," he said,
"but I don't know what the table was
for, because he didn't eat on a table, you
know, 'cause he was on'y a dog; but he
stealed a bone, and he was wunning away
wid it over some watah, and saw his
shadow looking like anudder dog wid a
bone, an' he was so greedy dat he dropped
his bone to get de bone of de odder dog in
de ribber, and so he lost his own bone and
<a class="pagenum" name="page_87" title="87"> </a>
didn't get any odder, and Josie Thompson
didn't get any bone eider."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ralph," said Winnie, "you tell
everything you know, besides much that
you don't!"</p>

<p>How the girls laughed when Winnie
explained! And all the more as laughter
came easy to them, with hearts light from
the consciousness of a well-spent year
which had brought its reward.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />

<small>A TRIP TO MAMMOTH CAVE.</small></h2>

evening, shortly
after the examination,
Fannie said to her
father: "Papa, I want
to invite the club for a
last meeting before
Ernestine leaves us. I
wish I could have
something in the way
of a treat different from anything we have
had."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that. Your
mother is so busy getting ready for the
summer, and we are going away so soon,
that I hardly see how we can arrange it."</p>

<p>Fannie looked at her father in blank
dismay. But he went on unmoved:</p>

<p>"In fact, Fannie, I have been thinking
that these meetings, as you call them, are
becoming somewhat monotonous." (Fannie's
eyes opened wide.) "No, I don't
think we can have it at all."</p>

<p>This was too much, and Fannie's
speechless indignation found voice:
"Papa Allen, I didn't think this of you!"
Then, seeing the well-known twinkle in
his eyes, she perched herself on his knee
and said, "Now, papa, what are you
up to?"</p>

<p>"Well, as the immortal Peter Pindar
says, as reported by McGuffey, 'I love to
please good children,' and as you have all
been 'kind and civil,' I have concluded to
give you what I call a grand treat. So
prepare for a shock."</p>

<p>"Go ahead, papa. I'm not afraid of it
at all; what I was afraid of was&mdash;none."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you say to my taking
all of you, the whole company of warriors,
to Mammoth Cave?"</p>

<p>Fannie sprang from his knee and fairly
danced around the room for joy. Then
she quieted herself and said, "When,
papa?"</p>

<p>"Just before the Fourth, I think.
Your mother and I will go, and possibly
Ernestine's uncle, who will be here by that
time; and I thought we might invite
'Miss Kitty,' of whom I have heard so
much."</p>

<p>So it came about that on a warm afternoon
in July, a party of eight, escorted to
the boat by several friends, ascended the
narrow staircase of the steamboat, and
made themselves comfortable on deck until
the "All aboard!" was heard, when the
escort hurried down the stairs to the
wharf.</p>

<p>When the boat had floated entirely out
of sight of the waving handkerchiefs of
<a class="pagenum" name="page_88" title="88"> </a>
their friends, the party, taking their hand
luggage, went into the cabin to find their
staterooms and deposit their belongings.
They had four staterooms in all. Fannie
and Miriam occupied one communicating
with that of Fannie's parents; and Ernestine,
Gretta, Winnie and her Aunt Kitty
had another similar suite. This duty
over, they went on deck to enjoy the
sweet, fresh air from the river and the
beautiful scenery along its banks.</p>

<p>Just after the short landing which had
been made at Lawrenceburg, supper was
called, and they were all ready to respond.
The colored waiters were delighted to find
such a party of young girls, and served
them with the utmost alacrity, anticipating
every want in a delightful manner.</p>

<p>After supper they sat on deck till long
after dark. Mr. Allen and Mr. Van Orten
were exchanging reminiscences of their
college days; and later, joined by Mrs.
Allen, of summers passed at beautiful
Lake George and in the White Mountains.
To all of this the remainder of the
party listened with absorbing interest.
However, the air, which had first given
them so good an appetite for supper, now
made them sleepy, so that by ten o'clock
the girls had all climbed into their narrow
berths and were soon sound asleep.</p>

<p>They had breakfast on the boat, so were
ready to continue their journey by rail
without interruption. After a pleasant
ride through a picturesque country they
reached Cave City, where they were transferred
to a tram&mdash;an engine and one
coach&mdash;which took them first up and
then down hill over a road cut right
through the woods, so that in some places
the trees almost interlaced over the top of
the coach. It was most delightful to all
the party, and would have been only too
short had it not been for what was to
follow. It formed a fit introduction
to the sublime and wonderful results of
Nature's long and patient work which
they were to see. Therefore, in spite of
the novelty and beauty, they were glad to
reach the hotel, a long, rambling, wooden
building, so unlike anything the girls had
ever before seen that the short stay within
its quaint rooms, with their bare floors and
whitewashed walls, was in itself an experience
long to be remembered.</p>

<p>After a night's refreshing sleep they
were ready to start out bright and early
for the first day's adventures. With
many girlish giggles they arrayed themselves
in the costumes provided by the
Cave management&mdash;the short woolen
skirts and loose blouses carrying with
them a delightfully free and unconventional
feeling&mdash;and then, at the sound of
the gong, set forth with their guide; Mr.
and Mrs. Allen in the lead, close behind
them Miss Kitty and Miriam, next Fannie
and Gretta, then Ernestine with one hand
locked in that of her uncle and the other
tightly holding Winnie's fingers, while
the interesting and friendly dog, "Brigham,"&mdash;so
called, the guide explained, because
he was no longer young&mdash;divided
his attentions between them, but seemed
<a class="pagenum" name="page_89" title="89"> </a>
most inclined to make friends with Miss
Kitty, who was accused of having a piece
of meat in her pocket as the only way to
account for her mysterious fascination for
his dogship.</p>

<p>They had a short but beautiful walk
through the fern-decorated woods, down
a steep path, over a little bridge, till they
found themselves on a stone platform directly
in front of an enormous opening in
the hill, a natural arch overhung with
trees, rocks, ferns and wild-flowers&mdash;a
sight never to be forgotten, so wonderfully
beautiful and grand was it&mdash;and the
party stepped back to admire it.</p>

<p>When they went forward again in order
to enter, they saw that what was an arch
above was a gaping chasm below, which
looked ready to swallow them, and down
which there seemed no way to go except
to fall headlong. Their guide watched
their dismay with amusement, but presently
Miriam discovered a narrow flight of
steps cut out of the solid rock. Down
these they went, shaded by the trees, under
the sparkling cascade, beneath the
black, overhanging rock, winding their
way along to where the last bit of daylight
is swallowed up, and then, with various
kinds of sensations, watched the guide unlock
the iron gate through which they
were to pass on their way to the mysterious
region of the nether world. As they
took their lamps and the gate closed behind
them with a clang, Miriam confided
to Miss Kitty that she felt little shivers
running up and down her back.</p>

<p>As the darkness became more intense,
Winnie slipped away from Ernestine to
her Aunt Kitty, whose hand she seized
with a breath of relief, as if feeling safer
there; and Gretta and Fannie clung
closely together.</p>

<p>As they advanced, the sense of mystery
increased, and for a minute the girls huddled
together in a bunch. Brigham, however,
sniffed once more&mdash;a little contemptuously,
according to Miss Kitty&mdash;and
then ran ahead on side trips of his
own, returning to the party from time to
time as if to reassure them that everything
was all right and they might place implicit
confidence in his knowledge of the
Cave and his friendship for them.</p>

<p>Their first stop was made in the Rotunda
in order to examine the saltpeter
vats, in which Ernestine, in keeping with
her liking for history, was much interested
when she heard that the saltpeter
made here was taken to Philadelphia to
be used in the manufacture of gunpowder
during the war of 1812.</p>

<p>Presently they entered Methodist Hall&mdash;so
named, as they were assured by their
guide, "because it's a heap too dry for the
Baptis'." In this place was the natural
pulpit from which&mdash;so tradition says&mdash;Booth
once delivered Hamlet's soliloquy.</p>

<p>Next they came to Gothic Avenue,
where their way lay along piles of stone
erected by admirers of famous men, States,
and so on. There was one little pile
which seemed to have been neglected, and
Miss Kitty asked whose it was. On being
<a class="pagenum" name="page_90" title="90"> </a>
told that it was the Old Maid's Monument,
she exclaimed: "I shall find nothing
nearer my heart!" and, picking up a
stone, carefully balanced it on the top of
the pile. But in spite of her care, it
rolled off. "That's a shore sign, Miss,
that you ain't gwine to be a ole maid."</p>

<p>"Can it be!" she said, as the elders of
the company laughingly congratulated
her. "Once more I feel a breath of
hope."</p>

<p>By and by they reached Register Hall,
which has been aptly described as a huge
autograph album, for on its ceiling,
smoked by burning candles, can be found
names and addresses from all parts of the
world, while address cards are placed in
numberless nooks and crevices. Here
Gretta sat in the arm-chair in which, so it
is said, Jenny Lind once sat and sang.</p>

<p>The next thing which pleased all of
them, and particularly Fannie, was the
water clock&mdash;a tick-tock sound made by
the dropping of a little stream of water
into a pool below&mdash;and they all laughed
at William when he said, "But it ain't a
eight-day clock, because it runs down
every twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>When they saw the Giant's Coffin they
looked upon it with awe&mdash;for it was a
gruesome sight enough&mdash;until Mr. Allen
said in a loud aside to Mr. Van Orten:</p>

<p>"This is the coffin in which the Warrior
Maidens deposit the bodies of their
victims."</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen smiled faintly, but Miss
Kitty&mdash;more at Mr. Van Orten's puzzled
expression than at the speech itself&mdash;laughed
outright. Winnie and Ernestine
had not heard, and Gretta hardly
knew whether to laugh or be offended, until
Fannie and Miriam, catching the joke,
re-echoed Miss Kitty's laugh.</p>

<p>From a crevice behind the Giant's
Coffin they went slipping and sliding
down an incline, and then up and down,
till they came to a small, round opening
in what seemed to be a solid wall. "Stay
here," said the guide; and he disappeared
through the hole with his lights. Then
he called to them, and, peering through
the aperture, they found it to be a
natural window opening into a great,
beautiful chamber&mdash;Gorin's Dome, considered
by many, said the guide, to be the
finest room in the Cave, with its immense
extent, measuring two hundred feet from
floor to ceiling, and covering an entire
acre of space.</p>

<p>From here they went to the pits, and,
standing on the Bridge of Sighs, a lowered
ball of flame showed them that they
were directly suspended over the deepest,
known as the Bottomless Pit. Winnie
and Gretta caught their breath quickly,
and Ernestine's hand tightened on her
uncle's arm; indeed, the whole party was
glad to get away from that dangerous
spot.</p>

<p>The next place visited, however, made
up to them for any amount of hard travel
or moment of terror. Having retraced
their steps till they came to the original
passage, they went on for some distance
<a class="pagenum" name="page_91" title="91"> </a>
until told by their guide to rest for a
moment on a convenient stone seat, and
wait there until he called to them. He
then took away all of their lamps and disappeared.
For a moment they felt the
darkness something frightful, but before
it had lasted long enough to be painful,
they saw a vision overhead of numberless
stars shining down upon them from a
cloudless dome.</p>

<p>That which for one moment in the
darkness had almost provoked a cry of
terror from more than one of the party,
became a cry of delight; and then Mrs.
Allen wondered aloud how they could see
the stars so far below the surface of the
earth. But even as she spoke, the scene
changed. They no longer saw a clear sky,
but the stars disappeared behind heavy
clouds, and then they were again in that
indescribably awful darkness. But gradually
a soft light was seen, and they heard
the bleating of sheep and the lowing of
cattle as they wake in the early dawn.
"Beautiful! Beautiful!" they said, and
were almost sorry when they found out
that these sounds were produced by their
guide, who turned out to be something
of a ventriloquist, and that the stars and
rosy dawn are but optical illusions called
forth by skillful manipulation of the light
thrown on the crystals which sparkle in
the dome with its coating of black oxide
of manganese.</p>

<p>From here they wended their way back,
followed by Brigham, who had waited for
them on the road to the Star Chamber,
feeling that they had experienced and
seen enough for one day.</p>

<p>They rested all that day and the next,
doing nothing that required more exertion
than short walks through the woods or
promenades along the wide galleries which
surrounded both stories of the hotel. Here
they swung hammocks, and rested in the
open air between their little walks.</p>

<p>But on the third day all the members
of the party again set out for the Cave,
starting in the morning, for they were
warned that going and returning it
would be a sixteen-mile walk. Presently
they found that the road they had taken
on the previous day diverged, and soon
they were going through the Valley of
Humility leading into Fat Man's Misery, a
place but eighteen inches wide, five feet
high, and changing direction eight times.
Through the one hundred and five yards
of this place they twisted and crawled,
until they reached Great Relief. Here
they stopped to congratulate Mrs. Allen,
the stoutest of the party, and Mr. Van
Orten, the tallest, on having successfully
passed this ordeal.</p>

<p>On again, now ascending a flight of
stairs to a higher gallery, now descending
to one below, always surprised at finding
the immense columns piercing through
from the highest galleries down to the
very lowest of the five levels of the Cave.
They passed through Bacon Chamber&mdash;which
Winnie did not think at all "romantic"&mdash;and
through various winding
passages, to River Hall, where all the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_92" title="92"> </a>
waters of the Cave collect, and where
they gazed with awe on the deep lakes.
Then they came to the Dead Sea, surrounded
on all sides by massive cliffs,
from which they descended by means of a
stairway to the banks of the River Styx,
which the party crossed by a natural
bridge to Lake Lethe; then along the
Great Walk, with its fine, yellow sand, to
Echo River. Here they found a boat
waiting for them, and, embarking, were
paddled along over the clear water&mdash;thirty
feet deep&mdash;singing, whistling,
and shouting to waken the echoes from
the rocky walls on either side, until it
seemed&mdash;so Miss Kitty said&mdash;as if
"Echo had been transferred from her
former mountain home, with all her
nymphs."</p>

<p>But no, it was not the Mountain Echo,
but her unknown sister who dwelt in these
underground regions, as their guide
proved to them by striking the long vault
with his cane; for it had its own keynote,
which excited harmonies of wonderful
depth and sweetness, each sound being
prolonged many seconds.</p>

<p>Here, too, they saw the eyeless fish,
and Gretta even went the length of pitying
them, until Miss Kitty told her that,
as they were not "fish with little lanterns
on their tails,"&mdash;which she had once
heard given as an explanation of some
phosphorescent phenomenon on an ocean
trip&mdash;and so could not see in those dark
waters even if they had eyes, she need not
waste her pity.</p>

<p>Soon they reached Washington Hall,
and perceived a waiter, who had been following
them at a distance, emerge from
the gloom, bringing with him a great
basket of lunch. This was a pleasant
surprise, and they partook heartily of the
generous repast, unmoved for the time by
their gnome-like surroundings in the
semi-darkness of this great chamber, so
dimly lighted by the various lanterns and
torches.</p>

<p>Beyond this place they found the
crystalline gardens, where the crystals
take the form of flowers and vines, and
even grapes&mdash;as in Mary's Vineyard&mdash;and
later they came upon a snowstorm in
a chamber so thickly covered with snowy
crystals that they were made to fall like
flakes by a loud concussion of the air.</p>

<p>And so they proceeded on their journey
and came to the Corkscrew. After a brief
consultation, they decided to take this
short cut out of the Cave, instead of going
over what is now somewhat familiar
ground. So up they climbed, partly by
means of the three ladders, now through
cracks, again over huge boulders scattered
here and there in wild confusion, now
twisting up through round holes&mdash;five
hundred feet of climbing, although they
were assured by their guide that the vertical
distance was only one hundred and
fifty feet.</p>

<p>At last they emerged on the edge of a
cliff just over the main cave, and, as they
stopped to take breath, wondered for a
moment if they were in another Star
<a class="pagenum" name="page_93" title="93"> </a>
Chamber, for the stars were shining bright
above them! But no; this time it was no
illusion, for though they had left the
bright sunlight behind them when they
made the descent into the lantern-lighted
darkness, they had been all day in the
cave, and were indeed glad that they had
saved the mile and a half walk by their
ascent through the Corkscrew.</p>

<p>Altogether it was a trip long to be remembered;
the more so that, at its close,
when they were all back in "dear, old,
smoky Cincinnati," as Miss Kitty fondly
called it, came the first parting of the
ways for the Warrior Maidens. Not the
ordinary summer parting, but one which
entirely changed the parallel grooves in
which their lives had been running, at
least for one of them, for Ernestine was
to go home with her uncle to New York.
The whole Burton family had become so
attached to her that they would gladly
have kept her with them as a much-loved
member of their circle, necessary not only
to their happiness but to their comfort,
and Ralph expressed his opinion that
Ernie's uncle was a bad, bad man.</p>

<p>But, while in compliance with his sister's
wish, expressed to Mr. Allen on that
day on which Mrs. Alroy had sent for him,
he had waited for the end of the school
year before coming for his niece, he was
now only too impatient to take to her kindred
the lovely child&mdash;the last living
link between their family and the sister
whom he and his brothers had so loved
and so mourned.</p>

<p>And so, one bright morning in July,
the little company, each wearing her
badge of warriorhood, went to the station
to see their dear friend start on her journey.
There were tearful faces on the outside
of the car, and a pale but earnest and
loving face hidden behind a handkerchief
on the inside, as the train slowly moved
out of the station.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />

<small>AN EXCHANGE OF LETTERS.</small></h2>


<p class="center"><i>Ernestine to Winnifred.</i></p>

<p class="margright15">New York, Sept. 12.</p>

<p class="indent0">Dearest Winnifred:</p>

<p>It seems a long time since I left you
standing in the station, the afternoon I
said good-by to the city which had been
my home. I can never forget you nor the
dear schoolmates who made my life there
so pleasant, nor the friends who took me
to their hearts in my great sorrow.</p>

<p>I was happy and contented in my little
home, so happy with my precious mother's
care and companionship, that nothing can
ever come into my life to bring greater
happiness, or greater desire to do and be
good, and our little society helped me.</p>

<p>And yet, dear Winnie, I would not have
my mother back to suffer. How much
she must have suffered in her isolation
from her people, I never knew until I
came among them. Never could orphan
have found more lovely relatives. I inclose
in this my letter to the club, to be
read at your next meeting.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_94" title="94"> </a>
With my heart full of gratitude to your
mother and all the rest, I am,</p>

<p class="margright30">Your loving friend,</p>

<p class="margright15">Ernestine.</p>

<hr />

<p class="center"><i>Ernestine to the Warrior Maidens.</i></p>

<p class="indent0">Dear Girls:</p>

<p>When you read this you will all be together
at Miriam's and I know you will
wish, as I do, that I could be with you.
I am here at my grandmother's home,
and a beautiful place it is, with its large
rooms and fine, old-fashioned furniture.
It is in a very quiet neighborhood, which
will seem strange to you when I say that it
is but a few minutes' walk from Broadway,
with its crowds of people, who always
seem in a hurry.</p>

<p>When Uncle Morris and I first reached
New York, we went straight to his home.
His wife received me very kindly, and my
cousins (one a young lady, another a girl
about my own age, and two boys younger,)
were kind, too, and they all wanted me to
stay with them. But my grandparents
said they must have me, and I was glad to
come, for I felt strange with so many new
cousins, and was afraid I would find it
hard to fall into their ways.</p>

<p>I have such a beautiful room, all my
own. It has east windows which open
over a little court, where the first thing I
see when I throw back my shutters in the
morning, is a fountain sparkling in the
sun, with rainbows in its spray, and birds
flying about and bathing in the pool.</p>

<p>At first there was some talk of sending
me to a school to prepare for Vassar, but
my grandmother said she had just found
me and could not give me up, and my
grandfather&mdash;with tears in his eyes,
which nearly broke my heart, for I knew
what he was thinking of&mdash;said the same
thing; so I am to have teachers right here
at home, and have already commenced
music and French.</p>

<p>I am sure I shall be very happy; but,
for all that, I imagine you all seated at
your desks at school, or chatting with each
other over your lunch, and that makes me
feel very lonely. But I mean to make the
best of my opportunities, and shall keep
in mind our watchword, "Now," which
means much more to me than when we
first chose it.</p>

<p>I hope we will all meet again sometime,
and that you will always think of me with
love, as</p>

<p class="margright30">Your loving</p>

<p class="margright15">Ernestine.</p>

<hr />

<p class="center"><i>Gretta to Ernestine.</i></p>

<p class="indent0">Dear Friend:</p>

<p>We all miss you very much, and it
seems hard to wait for the "sometime"
to come when we shall see you again.</p>

<p>You remember the idea of "fighting
giants" seemed silly to me at first, but I
can see now that it did me a great deal of
good, especially about my school work. I
never stood so well in any other examination
as in the last one for the high-school;
and I never blamed myself, but
always my "music." Now I see, though,
that two things may be well done as well
<a class="pagenum" name="page_95" title="95"> </a>
as one, if only we go about it in the right
way.</p>

<p class="margright30">Good-by,</p>

<p class="margright15">Gretta.</p>

<hr />

<p class="center"><i>Miriam to Ernestine.</i></p>

<p class="indent0">Dearest Ernestine:</p>

<p>How we did miss you the first day of
school, particularly when your name was
read as having the highest per cent. in the
whole city! And after the classes were
formed, every teacher inquired for you,
and all looked disappointed when they
found that you had moved away.</p>

<p>Our little Winnifred was only five behind
you, and not one of us stood less
than ninety. We went back to see Miss
Brownlow one day last week, and she said
she was proud of us. She asked for you
and sent her love.</p>

<p>We are struggling with x, y, z, and in
Latin have reached "uterque, utraque,
utrumque," which sounds about as sensible
as onery, twoery, etc. I feel sorry for
those people who must have found it no
laughing matter to put a different ending
to every word for every case, gender and
number, and I must say that for myself I
like plain English.</p>

<p>I saw Josie Thompson the other day,
and I laughed to myself when I thought
of her trying to fight her way through
such things as these. She said she was
"enjoying herself gorgeously!"</p>

<p>We mean to keep up with the record of
last year if we can, especially the record
of good times.</p>

<p class="margright30">With lots of love,</p>

<p class="margright15">Miriam.</p>

<hr />

<p class="center"><i>Fannie to Ernestine.</i></p>

<p class="indent0">My Dear, Dear Ernestine:</p>

<p>How strange it seems that your uncle
and my father are friends, and have almost
always been friends, and that just as
you and I began to know each other you
should have to go so far away! But papa
says he means to take me with him to New
York during the holidays, and then I will
see you again.</p>

<p>It seems strange to think that we really
go to the high-school, and it makes me
feel quite grown-up and as if I ought to be
dignified; but Winnie is the same demure
little puss and looks very small and childish
among so many big girls, some of
whom actually wear long dresses.</p>

<p>Miriam is as lively as ever, and keeps us
all laughing at lunch time. You know it
isn't what she says so much as the way she
says it that is so very funny.</p>

<p>But it is time for me to get my algebra
lesson, so I will close now.</p>

<p class="margright30">Au revoir,</p>

<p class="margright15">Fannie.</p>

<hr />

<p class="center"><i>Winnie to Ernestine.</i></p>

<p class="indent0">Dear Ernestine:</p>

<p>We had the first meeting for this year
at Miriam's last Friday evening, and the
first thing we did was to go up to Miriam's
room and read your letter. I read it out
loud first, but that wasn't enough, and it
passed from hand to hand, each one reading
it for herself.</p>

<p>We had such a nice little meeting, and
while we didn't talk quite so much as we
<a class="pagenum" name="page_96" title="96"> </a>
did a year ago about fighting giants, I
think we all felt that those we had been
able to fight had made it easier for us
to see and do our duties as they came
to us.</p>

<p>After we had read your letter and our
business meeting was over, we went down
into Miriam's yard and had a regular
frolic. It was a bright moonlight night,
and we had games and told stories and old
riddles and tried to make up new ones&mdash;but
didn't succeed very well&mdash;and by and
by Miriam's brother came out with an
enormous watermelon on a great, big tray.
It was a warm night&mdash;you know how
warm it is sometimes here in September&mdash;and
I don't know which we enjoyed
most, eating the cool, refreshing fruit or
snapping the seeds at each other.</p>

<p>We all miss you very much. Ralph
still asks when you are coming back, and
no one's paper dolls please him so much as
yours did. Sometimes I feel very lonely
without you, but Aunt Kitty says she is
sure you will come to visit us some time,
and that we are only twenty-four hours
apart, which does not seem so very far,
